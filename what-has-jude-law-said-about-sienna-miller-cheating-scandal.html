This series is based on a book of the same name and stars Jude Law's ex, Sienna Miller. Though the scandal was a time-stopping affair, it didn't seem to slow down his career as much as Sienna's. Since the 2005 sandal, Jude has been busier than ever gaining more and more popularity by the year, while Sienna has seen much smaller roles. Prior to Anatomy of a Scandal, her last top-billed performance was in the poorly rated 2020 film, Wander Darkly.Though the magnitude of the scandal seems to have died down, it hasn't stopped Sienna from being rather vocal about her very public breakup and recovery. All the while, Jude has stayed quiet for years, only releasing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a short statement of sorrow and regret shortly after his affair with his children's nanny was outed</a>. He has had to <a href=#>repair broken relationships with both Sienna and his children</a> as his career continued to thrive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-jude-law-and-sienna-miller-meet>How Did Jude Law and Sienna Miller Meet?</h2><p>In 2003, Jude and Sienna met on the set of the film Alfie, inspired by Lewis Gilbert's 1996 hit of the same name. The film follows limo driver Alfie Cartwright (Jude Law) as he sleeps his way through New York City. The young man meets Nikki (Sienna) and tries but fails to change his playboy ways, a sorrowful foreshadowing of what was to come for the soon-to-be couple.</p><p>During the movie's 2004 worldwide premiere in London, the stars made their public debut as an official couple in matching black outfits. They kept close during each following premiere as well as the press tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once the announcement of their relationship was made, things moved quickly for Jude and Sienna. They were engaged by the end of 2004 and seemed to be happy and in love before news of Jude's <a href=#>affair with Daisy Wright, the nanny of his children, Iris, Raf, and Rudy broke</a>.</p><p>Jude <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">soon released a statement saying</a>: "Following the reports in today's papers, I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. I want to publicly apologize to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. There is no defense for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Say There's A Reason Sienna Miller's Career Tanked</a></span></p><p>Sienna, who was doing a play at the time and the blow was "devastating" by May 2006 the two called off the engagement and split. In 2009, they reconciled and Sienna began wearing her ring once again. They split one final time in 2011 and have not gotten back together since. Though it is a rather difficult time to reflect on, Sienna told Variety that she believes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">being with Jude protected her from Harvey Weinstein's abuse</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-jude-law-spoken-about-the-scandal-recently>Has Jude Law Spoken About The Scandal Recently?</h2><p>Though he is known for being off the grid as far as social media, Jude still has yet to mention his cheating scandal. Though he does not shy away from press tours and interviews for his upcoming film, he keeps his private life just that — private. Though the <a href=#>pair continue to be cordial when necessary</a>, it's safe to say they are not friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are Jude Law And Emma Thompson Related?</a></span></p><p>Sienna and Jude have both been in several relationships since their breakup with Sienna recently being linked to fellow actor Oli Green.</p><p>Though Jude hasn't recently addressed the ages-old scandal, nor Sienna's recent role and the connection to it, fans speculate that she both took and excels in the role because she is aware of what it means to be in such a public predicament.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Think Jude Law Is Not Aging Well, Here's Why</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sienna has even said on Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>, "Never trust the British men," which fans think could be a dig at Jude.</p><h2 id=how-similar-is-anatomy-of-a-scandal-to-jude-and-sienna-s-story>How Similar Is Anatomy Of A Scandal To Jude And Sienna's Story?</h2><p>Since beginning work on the series, Sienna has loved every second of it. She has not shied away from mentioning the parallels between the series and her relationship with Jude. She even went as far as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">saying that filing the series was like, "free therapy,"</a> as she plays the wife of an unfaithful husband who wants to sweep all of their problems under the rug.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, fans eagerly await the day that Jude speaks up about his actions beyond a public apology.
