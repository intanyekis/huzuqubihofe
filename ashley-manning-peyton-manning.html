His wife, Ashley Manning, has been his biggest supporter for over 20 years.</p><p>Businesswoman Ashley Manning met her husband through a neighbor, and the two got hitched immediately. They made it work despite being students at the University of Virginia. He is in Tennessee.</p><p>After marriage, they moved to any city where the illustrious NFL quarterback played, and they now have two kids.&nbsp;</p><p>She supports his professional choices and has always pushed him to improve. Let’s get to know the details about them and their relationship;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>So who is Peyton Manning?</h2><p>Born in New Orleans in 1976, he was selected in the 1998 National Football League draft at the age of 22.&nbsp;</p><p>His career debut was with the Indianapolis Colts the same year, where he spent 18 seasons before moving on to play for the Denver Broncos for four seasons before retiring.&nbsp;</p><p>Widely known as “The Sheriff,” he earned this moniker for his legendary quarterbacking skills, which helped him win two Super Bowl titles and one Most Valuable Player award.</p><p>Peyton has recognized that his wife Ashley has remained his support despite his accomplishments.&nbsp;</p><p>He earned the moniker “The Sheriff” during his playing career. And he won two Super Bowl titles and one for Most Valuable Player.</p><p>Peyton has recognized that his wife Ashley has remained his support despite his accomplishments.&nbsp;</p><p>On March 17, 2001, he married the woman who would help make some of the most significant career decisions of his life. In Memphis, the retired footballer switched from the Indianapolis Colts to the Denver Broncos – thanks to her persuasive efforts. Ashly welcomed this decision with open arms and unwavering support.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Ashley Manning?</h2><p>On December 2, 1974, Ashley was born in Memphis. Her husband is famous, but he is famous not only because of that.</p><p>As a successful developer with ownership of a real estate company, she’s endlessly impressive. Her degree in Marketing and Finance from the University of Virginia adds to her accolades.</p><p>Peyton describes her as the most thoughtful person he knows – high praises indeed!</p><p>The NFL player stated that Ashley earned As in school in the 2000 book “Manning: A Father, His Sons, and a Football Legacy” that he co-authored with his father.</p><p>Ashley increased her <a href=#>business</a> knowledge when she joined the Memphis Grizzlies, a National Basketball Association team in Tennessee, as a minority owner in 2012.</p><p>She wanted the Grizzlies to stay in Tennessee and positively impact the neighborhood, which inspired her to join the ownership group.</p><p>Throughout their lives, they had always supported each other’s work. She had encouraged him to persevere when he considered retiring in 2011. He went on to play for five more years before finally retiring. Meanwhile, she pursued her own business endeavors with him by her side all along.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>21 Years of Marriage of Peyton and Ashley Manning</h2><p>They became friends when Peyton attended a fraternity party in Ashley’s hometown the summer before his first year at the University of Tennessee.</p><p>They had been introduced by the person who lived next door to her parents, and although they had only briefly spoken, she quickly became the focus of his “coeducational” attention.</p><p>His pastel outfit turned her off, so he could have created a better first impression.&nbsp;</p><p>He also broke his commitment to leave after bed check so they could converse.</p><p>They only crossed paths again later in the season, but Peyton remained intrigued by their first encounter, and their shared friends made it easier for them to stay in touch.</p><p>It took four and a half hours to get there from her school, but Ashley would still come to watch his game. He would return the favor once he had a bad week or the season was done. It quickly developed into a routine.</p><p>She received 16 job offers in New York City alone after graduating from college, but she chose to take a marketing job in Knoxville to make it easier to see Peyton.</p><p>Peyton was happy that Ashley liked him for who he was on the inside because when they started dating, he had yet to achieve real popularity.</p><p>They announced their engagement in the summer of 2000. But kept it under wraps so it wouldn’t become news during football season.</p><p>The couple wed on St. Patrick’s Day in 2001. And they took a week off work for their honeymoon. However, they kept their destination a secret.</p><p>The wedding surprised many of his fans because they had kept their engagement a secret; his father, the former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning, said more than 500 people were in attendance.</p><p>Peyton Manning, Marshall Manning, Mosley Manning, and Brandon Stokely at the Ring of Honour induction ceremony on October 31, 2021, in Denver | Source: Getty Images</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peyton and Ashley Manning’s Children</h2><p>Ashley and Peyton welcomed their twins, boy Marshall Williams Manning and daughter Mosley Thompson Manning, two weeks after celebrating their tenth wedding anniversary.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCt0qGjnrFdoq6vusinnmaola7BsLqMppinppmjtHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fashley-manning-peyton-manning.html&text=Ashley%20Manning%20and%20Peyton%20Manning%3a%20Life%20After%2021%20Years%20Of%20Marriage&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fashley-manning-peyton-manning.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fashley-manning-peyton-manning.html&title=Ashley%20Manning%20and%20Peyton%20Manning%3a%20Life%20After%2021%20Years%20Of%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fashley-manning-peyton-manning.html&title=Ashley%20Manning%20and%20Peyton%20Manning%3a%20Life%20After%2021%20Years%20Of%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fashley-manning-peyton-manning.html&title=Ashley%20Manning%20and%20Peyton%20Manning%3a%20Life%20After%2021%20Years%20Of%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fashley-manning-peyton-manning.html&description=Ashley%20Manning%20and%20Peyton%20Manning%3a%20Life%20After%2021%20Years%20Of%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./debbie-morgan-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Death News!
