They started dating in 2018 and got engaged in 2020. "I decided to get engaged," Perry announced to People back then. "Luckily, I happened to be dating the greatest woman on the face of the planet at this time."</p><p>They split up six months after Perry proposed while he was at a rehab in Switzerland. They broke up for good in June 2021. "Sometimes things just don't work out and this is one of them," Perry said in a statement at that time. "I wish Molly the best."</p><p>Hurwitz posted an Instagram tribute to his ex, days after his death, saying that "he would love that the world is talking about how talented he was. And he really was very talented."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She even recalled, "As the Friends reunion was approaching, we rewatched the show together. 'F---, I was so good!!!…See what I did there???' We rewound and studied scenes. Our respect and appreciation of humor is something that connected us. Being with him as he rediscovered his brilliance was magical."</p><p>Before signing the lengthy post with what seems like a nickname Perry gave Hurwitz, "Moll-o-Rama(…fication)," she said she "obviously knew that man in a very different way, too" but that "while I loved him deeper than I could comprehend, he was complicated, and he caused pain like I'd never known."</p><p>She continued: "No one in my adult life has had a more profound impact on me than Matthew Langford Perry. I have tremendous gratitude for that, for everything I learned from our relationship [...] Matty, I feel relief that you are at peace."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-30t103058-248.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Actress Matthew Perry Was Devastated He Couldn't Work With During His Final Years In Hollywood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matthew Perry’s untimely demise also marks the end of some unfulfilled dreams, including the opportunity to work with an A-list Hollywood actress.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-perry-feared-intimacy-during-addiction-battle>Matthew Perry Feared Intimacy During Addiction Battle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Matthew-Perry-and-Julia-Roberts-on-Friends.jpg><p>In October 2022, ahead of the release of his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry told People about his fear of intimacy</a>. "That was me afraid," he said of breaking up with his famous exes. "I manifest something that’s wrong with them, and then I break up with them. But there can't be something wrong with everyone. I'm the common denominator. I left first because I thought they were going to annihilate me."</p><p>The Fools Rush In star wrote in his book that he broke up with Roberts just because he was scared she would dump him. "Two months later, I was single," he said of their brief romance. "Dating Julia Roberts had been too much for me. I had been constantly certain that she was going to break up with me. Why would she not? I was not enough; I could never be enough; I was broken, bent, unloveable."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also opened up about almost getting engaged to Mean Girls star, Lizzy Caplan. "All my fears reared up like a snake," he said of not being brave enough to pop the question. "I often think if I'd asked [her to marry me], now we'd have two kids and a house. Instead, I'm some schmuck who's alone in his house at fifty-three." They were together for six years until 2012.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matthew-perry-took-a-serious-approach-to-his-final-interview-with-david-letterman.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matthew Perry Took A Serious Approach To His Interview With David Letterman</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Letterman's Late Show interview took a turn after the host brought up Matthew Perry's recent rehab stint at the time.</span><h2 id=matthew-perry-was-ready-to-marry-and-have-kids>Matthew Perry Was Ready To Marry And Have Kids</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-29t093125-981.png><p>In October 2022, Perry told People that he was now "confident" to find love and hopefully start a family.

I'm going to learn as I go. The thing that's changed about me is I have no interest in hanging out with somebody that I don't know or somebody that I'm not that into."</p><p>He even quipped that "the next person I really take seriously is somebody that I'm going to be in love with and not be scared by the things that used to scare me." He then said that he was looking for "somebody who's self-supporting."</p><p>"In every way, but monetarily especially because I got burned a few times by women who wanted my money, not really caring about me," he added. "A sense of humor, beautiful inside and out, caring. This is really important, somebody who can have a back and forth with me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He was even looking forward to becoming a parent.
