(Fox and West, <a href=#>who met on New Year’s Eve 2022 in Miami</a>, announced their breakup one month later, on Valentine’s Day 2022.)</p><p>“I only could do it for so long because ultimately I think he needed a full-time person and I just couldn’t be full-time,” the Uncut Gems star explained. “I had my son [Valentino] and then he’d wanna talk on the phone a lot, like, I’d have to change diapers so I bought a pair of AirPods so I could keep it in while I was doing mom stuff. It was just — it was so overwhelming and so unsustainable.”</p><p>Fox, who refers to West as “The Artist” in her memoir, recalled how needy the Grammy winner was<a href=#> in their romance</a> — even though Valentino was her priority. (Fox shares her son with ex-husband <strong>Peter Artemiev</strong>, whom she divorced in 2020.)</p><p>“Ultimately I cannot put anybody else first,” Fox told Barrymore, 48,&nbsp;on Tuesday. “My son has to be first. It just became too much. I didn’t sign up to have two babies. I couldn’t do it. It felt like two babies.”</p><p>Fox recalled mistakenly thinking her relationship with the “Hurricane” rapper would not become public.</p><p>“When I first met him, I literally thought nobody would ever hear about it, because a lot of the time you date these celebrities but they’re very hush-hush and they’re like, ‘Don’t post a picture in my bathroom.’ So I kinda just thought it would be a secret,” she told Barrymore. “So when it suddenly got mysteriously leaked, it wasn’t me, I really was just not expecting that at all, and then I just embraced it. I was like, ‘OK, I’ll do the fashion, I’ll wear the clothes. I’ll do what he says.’”</p><p><a href=#>During their short-lived romance</a>, West was <a href=#>going through his high-profile divorce</a> from <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, with whom he shares four children. Fox remembered that the Chicago MC loved seeing her name in the headline.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Julia-Fox-Says-Kanye-West-Was-so-Needy-When-They-Dated-It-Was-Like-Having-a-Second-Baby2.jpg><p>“He did want me to be bigger. He did, like when I’d be getting a lot of press he was thrilled,” Fox said. “That’s the thing about him when he has a vision for someone, he gets very obsessed with the vision, and it becomes almost like his little project, his little masterpiece in a way.”</p><p>After the whirlwind of publicity, Fox is happy being single for now.</p><p>“I have, like, sworn off men. I just — if it ain’t broke don’t fix it,” she said.</p><p>West, for his part, finalized his divorce from Kardashian, 42, in November 2022. He wed <a href=#><strong>Bianca Censori</strong></a> one month later.</p><p>“Kanye and Bianca <a href=#>were legally married last year</a> when they had their private ceremony in Beverly Hills, it was real and legal,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month, adding that the couple decided to get married “because of religious reasons.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The duo wanted to “be intimate,” the insider noted, though they chose to knot because they are “also in love.”<br>“Kanye calls her his muse and loves dressing her up,” the source said.</p><p>As for West’s thoughts on his ex’s memoir, Fox told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong> </a>on Sunday, October 15, that <a href=#>she hasn’t heard from him</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyerm6yzrFkrJmpqHqlrdOipaBlm5a7urGMsJysrF2srrR5y6KinmWklriqusZmmpqqlWK8p3nAZmmnnF2osqS7zZ1km5mSrnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjulia-fox-says-dating-kanye-west-was-like-taking-care-of-a-2nd-second-baby.html&text=Julia%20Fox%20Says%20Dating%20Kanye%20West%20Was%20Like%20Taking%20Care%20of%20a%202nd%20Second%20Baby&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjulia-fox-says-dating-kanye-west-was-like-taking-care-of-a-2nd-second-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjulia-fox-says-dating-kanye-west-was-like-taking-care-of-a-2nd-second-baby.html&title=Julia%20Fox%20Says%20Dating%20Kanye%20West%20Was%20Like%20Taking%20Care%20of%20a%202nd%20Second%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjulia-fox-says-dating-kanye-west-was-like-taking-care-of-a-2nd-second-baby.html&title=Julia%20Fox%20Says%20Dating%20Kanye%20West%20Was%20Like%20Taking%20Care%20of%20a%202nd%20Second%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjulia-fox-says-dating-kanye-west-was-like-taking-care-of-a-2nd-second-baby.html&title=Julia%20Fox%20Says%20Dating%20Kanye%20West%20Was%20Like%20Taking%20Care%20of%20a%202nd%20Second%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjulia-fox-says-dating-kanye-west-was-like-taking-care-of-a-2nd-second-baby.html&description=Julia%20Fox%20Says%20Dating%20Kanye%20West%20Was%20Like%20Taking%20Care%20of%20a%202nd%20Second%20Baby" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mitch-haniger-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mitch Haniger Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jonathan-van-ness-accused-of-having-rage-issues-on-queer-eye-set.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jonathan Van Ness Accused of Having Rage Issues on Queer Eye Set">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
