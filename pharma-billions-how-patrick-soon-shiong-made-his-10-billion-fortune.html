One may assume healthcare isn’t as lucrative as its non-healthcare counterparts as it is without the very wide or rapid profit margins but there are few healthcare elites who have defied this narrative against all odds and made it to the league of 3-commas in the healthcare sector. Patrick Soon-Shiong is one of such elite and while his <a href=#>achievements are applauded</a> and recognized, many people still do not know who he is.

His parents were Chinese immigrants who had left China during World War II. By age 23, Patrick had <a href=#>obtained a degree</a> in medicine at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg where he graduated as the 4th best graduating student in a class of 189 at the young age of 23. Patrick had his medical internship at Johannesburg’s General Hospital before proceeding to obtain his master’s degree from the University of British Columbia in 1979 which earned him research awards from the Royal College of Physicians & Surgeons of Canada, the American College of Surgeons, and the American Association of Academic Surgery.</p><p>In 1983, Patrick <a href=#>relocated to the U.S</a> where he began his surgical training at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon a year later.

That's not all, he also performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant and the "first pig-to-man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients.</p><p>It was around this time he set up his Veterans Affairs hospital in West L.A, where he worked with three staff members. In 1998, he acquired Fujisawa which sold invitro generic drugs and he used the proceeds to create Abraxane, one of <a href=#>the most effective</a> breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer treatment medications.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Richest Woman In Asia: How Savitri Jindal Made Her $15.6 Billion Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=transition-to-big-pharma-road-to-billions>Transition To Big Pharma: Road to Billions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/A-Picture-Of-Patrick-Soon-Shiong.jpg> Via Flickr/NHS Confederation<p>Patrick probably never saw the waves Abraxane was going to make because after creating Abraxane, it became a success thanks to its effectiveness and efficacy against breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Two decades later, he sold <a href=#>his drug companies</a> American Pharmaceutical Partner and Abraxis Bioscience for a massive $9.1 billion; it was around this time he founded his multinational biotechnology conglomerate holding company NantWorks LLC which serves as a parent company for his NantHealth, NantOmics, NantPharma, Nantbiocell, and other groups of companies focused on biotech, <a href=#>artificial intelligence, and healthcare</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This accidental billionaire as he commonly calls himself is just someone who saw an opportunity to create medical inventions and solutions and turn them into a money-making venture while ensuring that he is the only one who remains at the top. Patrick is known for giving room for very minimal competition. In 2015, he acquired exclusive rights to the drug Cynviloq from Sorrento Therapeutics because the drug could have gone <a href=#>shoulder to shoulder</a> with his Abraxane should it make its way into the market and well, that would have been bad for business and probably reduce his profit margins.</p><h2 id=investments-shares-and-notable-purchases>Investments, Shares, And Notable Purchases</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/A-Picture-Of-Patrick-Soon-Shiong.jpg> Via Flickr/NHS Confederation <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Patrick Soon-Shiong who is currently estimated to be worth $10 billion despite all his <a href=#>investments and purchases</a> has proven time and time again that he is not only interested in biotech, but that he is interested in other fields as well.

He has a 2% stake in Celgene and after a merger between ImunityBio and NantKwest, he became <a href=#>a major shareholder</a> of both biotech firms in 2021 with about 80% stake. He also holds stakes in CytRx and the media firm, Tribune Publishing.</p><p>In 2010, the self-acclaimed accidental billionaire acquired a 4.5% stake in the professional basketball team, Los Angeles Lakers. He bought this stake for $27 million from the retired Lakers star <a href=#>Earvin </a><a href=#><i>Magic </i></a><a href=#>Johnson Jr.</a> and according to 2021 reports by Sportico, that stake is worth a massive $5.6 billion now. 2018 saw Patrick making a sleek move to acquire the Los Angeles Times and San Diego Tribunes for a whopping $500 million.
