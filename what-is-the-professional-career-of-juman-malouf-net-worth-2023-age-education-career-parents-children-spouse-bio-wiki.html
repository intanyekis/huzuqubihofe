There were people from England, America, Germany, and Switzerland. All these different types of people would come over for tea at my mom’s, and there were all these various people with all these histories. So I think I was interested in this idea of people who don’t fit into society.”</p><p>The Malouf moved to London once the Gulf War started in Saudi Arabia.
