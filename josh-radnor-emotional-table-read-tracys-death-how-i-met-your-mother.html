The final episode, as expected, was an emotional one. Fans find out about the passing of Ted's wife, Tracy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only was the shoot a difficult one, but the same held true for the final table read. Josh Radnor struggled to complete his lines, while Alyson Hannigan, Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, and Cristin Milioti were all in tears. Neil Patrick Harris was able to keep it together.</p><p>Ted's emotional lines read, "You see, kids, right from the moment I met your mom, I knew: I have to love this woman as much as I can... ... for as long as I can, and I can never stop loving her... ... not even for a second. I carried that lesson with me through every stupid fight we ever had. Every 5 a.m. Christmas morning, every sleepy Sunday afternoon. Through every speed bump, every pang of jealousy or boredom... ... or uncertainty that came our way, I carried that lesson with me. And I carried it with me when she got sick."</p><p><strong>An emotional scene and one the true fans of the show won't forget. The final table read is worth taking a look back at.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Is-How-I-Met-Your-Father-Worth-Watching-Heres-What-The-Reviews-Are-Saying.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Why Was How I Met Your Father Canceled After Season 2?">Why Was How I Met Your Father Canceled After Season 2?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Hilary Duff trolled a fan who called How I Met Your Father "cringe" after it was canceled.</p><p>It was quite the scene and although it seemed like Radnor wasn't ready for such a twist, that wasn't true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=josh-radnor-admits-he-knew-about-the-mother-twist-from-the-very-start>Josh Radnor Admits He Knew About The Mother Twist From The Very Start</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radnor knew the finale was going to be shocking</a>. However, Radnor was told early on that a mother twist was going to take place at some point down the road.</p><p>"They had mentioned to me the twist about the mother in the first season, and I kind of put it out of my head." He continues, "I didn't know if they would actually want to come back to it and do that, especially after Cristin, because she was so wonderful and the fans seemed to really take to her. So I asked them, 'Are you guys still doing that?' And they said yeah."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-i-met-your-mother-cast-1.jpg><p>Radnor knew the finale was going to be shocking, so the show did its best to soften the blow along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was going to be shocking no matter what and they wanted to soften it a little bit or at least get people talking about it," he said. "There were a couple of hints along the way: Ted's big speech to the mother in 'The Time Travelers.' That was the first time I heard people talking about that possibility."</p><p>Radnor would go on to reveal that the finale was very open-ended, with several possible scenarios taking place.</p><h2 id=josh-radnor-revealed-the-possibilities-for-the-finale-were-numerous-including-barney-and-robin-getting-together>Josh Radnor Revealed The Possibilities For The Finale Were Numerous, Including Barney And Robin Getting Together</h2><p>The possibilities for the finale were numerous, and that included what went on with Barney and Robin's characters. There was the chance of the doing ending up together. Even Radnor admitted this was a possibility during the finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/barney-how-i-met-your-mother.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There are so many opinions floating around. There have always been people that thought that Barney [Neil Patrick Harris] and Robin were perfect together, there have always been people that thought it didn't make sense. There are people that wanted Ted and Robin to be together. There are people that thought they didn't work together. So I just feel that part of the divisiveness and part of the anger and also part of the enthusiasm all speaks to something really great."</p><p>Ultimately, the actor was satisfied with the way the series wrapped up.</p><p><strong>"I'm a fan of the finale and obviously I'm a fan of the show. I think people are having to deal with grief on a number of levels. There's grief in the episode, but then there's grief at letting the show go."</strong></p><p>"I think when the dust settles people will feel pretty complete."</p><p>Radnor wasn't wrong as the show did a great job of giving fans closure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKuYYr%2BisM2oqWadnaTBqrvNmqNmrJGXuaZ50Z6YnWWkp66kxdJmm56ZpJ16qbvWZqBmpZWperq71KtkpqeknbKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjosh-radnor-emotional-table-read-tracys-death-how-i-met-your-mother.html&text=Josh%20Radnor%27s%20Table%20Read%20Of%20Tracy%27s%20Death%20On%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother%20Caused%20The%20Entire%20Cast%20To%20Breakdo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjosh-radnor-emotional-table-read-tracys-death-how-i-met-your-mother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-radnor-emotional-table-read-tracys-death-how-i-met-your-mother.html&title=Josh%20Radnor%27s%20Table%20Read%20Of%20Tracy%27s%20Death%20On%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother%20Caused%20The%20Entire%20Cast%20To%20Breakdo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjosh-radnor-emotional-table-read-tracys-death-how-i-met-your-mother.html&title=Josh%20Radnor%27s%20Table%20Read%20Of%20Tracy%27s%20Death%20On%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother%20Caused%20The%20Entire%20Cast%20To%20Breakdo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-radnor-emotional-table-read-tracys-death-how-i-met-your-mother.html&title=Josh%20Radnor%27s%20Table%20Read%20Of%20Tracy%27s%20Death%20On%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother%20Caused%20The%20Entire%20Cast%20To%20Breakdo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjosh-radnor-emotional-table-read-tracys-death-how-i-met-your-mother.html&description=Josh%20Radnor%27s%20Table%20Read%20Of%20Tracy%27s%20Death%20On%20How%20I%20Met%20Your%20Mother%20Caused%20The%20Entire%20Cast%20To%20Breakdo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./richard-zokol.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Richard Zokol">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jennifer-walcott.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Walcott Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
