The score was 1-0 in Canada's favor after Ontario's Jessie Fleming scored a penalty goal. Team US has been on top for the past couple of years and this loss came as a shock for everyone including Rapinoe whose comments to the press after the defeat didn't sit well with Canadians. This was the first time in the past 20 years that the US had lost to Canada and Rapinoe said, "It's terrible."</p><p>“We just didn’t have it today. Just too many errors from us again. I felt like the space was there for us to play and we just couldn’t get into it, too many touches or, you know, an errant touch," she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>ESPN</a>. “So yeah, it’s a bitter one to swallow. Obviously, we never want to lose to Canada. I don’t think I’ve ever lost to Canada," the 36-year-old said. "Rapinoe cries like a baby after the <a href=#>women's soccer team</a> is defeated in epic fashion," one of the tweets read. Another user quoting <a href=#>Rapinoe's comments</a> about losing tweeted, "Megan Rapinoe: 'It sucks, you never want to lose to Canada' says forward as USWNT beaten by Canada in <a href=#>semifinals at Tokyo 2020</a> As a proud Canadian, I say 'Get used to it.

She has always felt responsible to harness her talents to help others as a young kid, learning from her mother. Inspired by Colin Kaepernick's protest against racial injustice, Rapinoe took the knee for the first time in 2016 during the national anthem before Seattle Reign's NWSL game against the Chicago Red Stars on September 5. "It was very intentional," she told American Soccer Now adding that it was her little nod to Kaepernick and everything he was standing for. She knelt again a few days later in Maryland. Her work as an activist as well as an exceptional sportswoman led her to Victoria's Secret for which she received a lot of hate online. However, she seems to have remained unaffected by the pushback.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>What is Megan Rapinoe's net worth?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Rapinoe's net worth is estimated at $3 million. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>SportyTell</a>, she makes an estimated $168,000 per year from playing for the US team. A sizable portion of her earnings also comes from her various endorsement deals which include Procter & Gamble, BodyArmor, Hulu, LUNA Bar, Smirnoff, Samsung, Vitamin Water, medical device company DJO Global and clothing company Wildfang. She also has a deal with Nike and the brand also launched a campaign titled 'You Can't Stop Us' in collaboration with her in 2020.</p><p>She has been playing for the US women's national soccer team since 2006 and has scored 54 goals and assisted 69 goals in 170 appearances. Apart from being one of the best soccer players in the world, she is known for fighting for pay parity. “It’s not easy to constantly have to demand your worth. Or tell people how good you are. Or tell people you deserve to be a full human,” Rapinoe said in an HBO Max documentary about the US women's national soccer team's lawsuit for equal pay against US Soccer. The federal judge dismissed the claims in May 2020 but the team filed an appeal this year ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7b7a580b-68d9-4e09-b8d8-3cf135c0de58.1308964938><p>Rapinoe had spoken about the disparity between the salaries between male and female players at the White House before a Congressional panel. She <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a>, “The United States women’s national team has won four World Cup championships and four Olympic gold medals on behalf of our country. We have filled stadiums, broken viewing records, and sold-out jerseys, all popular metrics by which we are judged. Yet despite all of this, we are still paid less than men – for each trophy, of which there are many, each win, each tie, each time we play. Less.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iWwW65xKCYp2Wilr2qus6eZKedpGLEsL7ToWSwoJGpeqa6w6iprJ2dmru1eceormalpZi1br%2FApZirsV2lsrN52J6Yqw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-megan-rapinoe-net-worth-what-endorsement-how-much-salary-per-year.html&text=What%20is%20Megan%20Rapinoe%27s%20net%20worth%3f%20USWNT%20star%20may%20be%20controversial%20but%20talent%20is%20not%20in%20doubt&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-megan-rapinoe-net-worth-what-endorsement-how-much-salary-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-megan-rapinoe-net-worth-what-endorsement-how-much-salary-per-year.html&title=What%20is%20Megan%20Rapinoe%27s%20net%20worth%3f%20USWNT%20star%20may%20be%20controversial%20but%20talent%20is%20not%20in%20doubt" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-megan-rapinoe-net-worth-what-endorsement-how-much-salary-per-year.html&title=What%20is%20Megan%20Rapinoe%27s%20net%20worth%3f%20USWNT%20star%20may%20be%20controversial%20but%20talent%20is%20not%20in%20doubt" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-megan-rapinoe-net-worth-what-endorsement-how-much-salary-per-year.html&title=What%20is%20Megan%20Rapinoe%27s%20net%20worth%3f%20USWNT%20star%20may%20be%20controversial%20but%20talent%20is%20not%20in%20doubt" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-megan-rapinoe-net-worth-what-endorsement-how-much-salary-per-year.html&description=What%20is%20Megan%20Rapinoe%27s%20net%20worth%3f%20USWNT%20star%20may%20be%20controversial%20but%20talent%20is%20not%20in%20doubt" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-rap-music-bad-influence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Is Rap Music Still Considered A Bad Influence?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-cruise-gives-update-on-val-kilmers-cancer-battle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Cruise Gives Update on Val Kilmers Cancer Battle">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
