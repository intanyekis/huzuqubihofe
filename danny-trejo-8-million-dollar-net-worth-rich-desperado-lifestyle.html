Often playing the stereotypical role of a mafia drug lord, a boxer, or a gangster, Trejo’s masculine and partially rough looks makes him just the perfect fit for action-based movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before he broke into Hollywood, Trejo served a sentence in a prison in California where he picked up boxing skills and became a champion in the prison’s lightweight and welterweight divisions. It was also during this time that he joined a program that helped him gradually overcome his <a href=#>drug addiction.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Michelle Pfeiffer Earns And Spends Her $250 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Following his release from prison, Trejo began his journey in acting. Over the course of his successful career, the ace actor has amassed an impressive net worth estimated at around $8 million. Here's a look into how Trejo made his millions!</p><h2 id=trejo-started-out-teaching-boxing-on-movie-sets><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Trejo Started Out Teaching Boxing On Movie Sets</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Danny Trejo, who was <a href=#>a boxing champion</a> in San Quentin, where he served time, was recognized on a movie set by a crime author, Edward Bunker. Bunker, who was also a screenplay writer, had previously served time in San Quentin, and he remembered Trejo for his excellent boxing skills, and offered Trejo $320 per day to train movie star Eric Roberts for a boxing scene he had to film.</p><h2 id=he-landed-several-minor-roles><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Landed Several Minor Roles</span></h2><p>After a support group meeting in 1985, Trejo met a man who called him for support. Trejo ended up meeting him on the set of Runaway Train (1985), and was offered a role as an extra, which is likely because of his tough appearance and distinct facial features. Trejo taught one of the movie stars on the set boxing, which impressed the film director Andrei Konchalovsky, and he offered him a small role as a boxer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=then-came-major-roles><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Then Came Major Roles</span></h2><p>Trejo became a force to reckon with in the entertainment industry with his stellar acting. It looks like the talented actor impressed the right people because, since Runaway Train, Trejo has enjoyed a highly prolific acting career. At times, he appears in over five movies per year across a variety of genres. Some of the major releases he has appeared in include Marked for Death, Desperado, From Dusk till Dawn, The Replacement Killers, <a href=#>Spy Kids</a>, and others.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Ashton Kutcher Earns And Spends His $200 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=trejo-produces-sometimes><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Trejo Produces Sometimes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his success as an actor, Trejo decided to explore the production scene. In 2014, he produced his first film Ambition with a budget of 11 million dollars. This was followed by the movie Bad Asses which was also released that same year.</p><h2 id=and-also-appears-in-television-shows><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And Also Appears In Television Shows</span></h2><p>Though mostly cast as a film actor, Trejo also has a successful career in television with roles in over seventy shows. Some of these series include <a href=#>Baywatch</a>, NYPD Blue, King of the Hill, Monk, Desperate Housewives, The Young and the Restless, Breaking Bad, and others.</p><h2 id=trejo-is-a-restaurant-owner><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Trejo Is A Restaurant Owner</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from playing a drug lord or a sweet uncle in movies, Trejo has a successful line of work outside of the lights and cameras. The talented actor, is also a successful restaurateur with about three outlets to his name. Trejo opened Trejo’s Tacos, the first of the franchise, in 2016 and followed it up with two more outlets Trejo’s Cantina and Trejo’s Coffee & Donuts the following year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s How Hilary Duff Earns And Spends Her Reported $25 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=video-game-voice-acting><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Video Game Voice Acting</span></h2><p>Danny takes acting to a whole new level so it really is no surprise that he is just as much of a versatile actor as he is talented. In addition to acting on screen, Trejo also lends his voice as a voice actor on video games.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trejo has lent his voice to popular video games such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002), Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories (2006), and Fallout: New Vegas (2010). In addition to this, he has also appeared in Call of Duty: Black Ops (2010), Taco Run! (2018), and Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2019).</p><h2 id=the-actor-also-doubles-as-an-author><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Actor Also Doubles As An Author</span></h2><p>Danny Trejo is living proof that you can do as many things as you want and excel in every single one of them. Apart from owning <a href=#>a multi-million dollar Taco empire</a> and being a versatile actor, Danny Trejo is also a published author. His cookbook is published and available for sale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're craving some Taco, but you don't live close to his restaurants, that's fine. Just walk into a bookstore and pick up a signed copy of his published cookbook and learn how to make some mouthwatering tacos. You'll definitely add a couple of dollars to the actor's net worth while you're at it.</p><p>When the word icon is mentioned, Danny should definitely come to mind. From an incarcerated boxer to one of Hollywood's top actors, Trejo is as inspiring as they come!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here’s How Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Earn And Spend Their Joint $370 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaernq1vsSjpmZwXaK2rbjIqKVmnJ%2BhuaK%2BjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyroJygXZmytLzEq5idp12htqex0q2wpZ1f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdanny-trejo-8-million-dollar-net-worth-rich-desperado-lifestyle.html&text=How%20Did%20Danny%20Trejo%20Earn%20His%20%248%20Million%20Net%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdanny-trejo-8-million-dollar-net-worth-rich-desperado-lifestyle.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-trejo-8-million-dollar-net-worth-rich-desperado-lifestyle.html&title=How%20Did%20Danny%20Trejo%20Earn%20His%20%248%20Million%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdanny-trejo-8-million-dollar-net-worth-rich-desperado-lifestyle.html&title=How%20Did%20Danny%20Trejo%20Earn%20His%20%248%20Million%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdanny-trejo-8-million-dollar-net-worth-rich-desperado-lifestyle.html&title=How%20Did%20Danny%20Trejo%20Earn%20His%20%248%20Million%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdanny-trejo-8-million-dollar-net-worth-rich-desperado-lifestyle.html&description=How%20Did%20Danny%20Trejo%20Earn%20His%20%248%20Million%20Net%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cass-holland-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Rich Is The TikTok Star?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./adam-tebben-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hot News!
