To achieve it requires dedication and a lot of efforts. Not many reach their goal in their life and they face quite the number of obstacles but if one doesn’t give up, success is just an arm’s length away.</p><p><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> is a late night talk show host who has also kissed success on its lips but only after facing many problems. Let us read about his journey to his fame and fortune along with his wiki-bio and relationships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_is_Stephen_Colbert%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth></span>What is Stephen Colbert’s Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to many sources, Colbert’s net worth is a whopping <strong>$45 million</strong>. This makes him the richest talk show host second only to, <strong>Conan O’Brien</strong>.</p><p>Stephen Colbert’s efforts on the&nbsp;Late Show&nbsp;earned him<strong> $15 million</strong>, which makes him the highest paid among the late-night hosts next to <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong>. In comparison, Conan O’Brien earns <strong>$12.5 million</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> <strong>$12 million</strong>.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bszb7PLlrsw/</p><p>The star began by joining Chicago’s Second City comedy troupe where he met comedians <strong>Amy Sedaris</strong> and <strong>Paul Dinello</strong>. Together they made and also starred in both Exit57 and Strangers with Candy.</p><p>In&nbsp;1997, Colbert began appearing in episodes of The Daily Show and in 2005, he got his own spin-off show, The Colbert Report.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael McIntyre Relationship details</a></strong></p><p>Stephen also published a book, I Am America (And So Can You!) I in 2007. Both Strangers and The Daily Show were running and the latter became a huge hit in the early 200os. Colbert’s career then started gaining traction, and his own show, a spin-off of The Daily Show was just around the corner.</p><p></p><p>In 2014, after <strong>David Letterman</strong> announced his plans to retire in 2015, Colbert replaced him as the host of CBS’ Late Show. In April 2014, CBS officially chose Colbert to replace Letterman.</p><p>The Colbert Report has been a Comedy Central powerhouse, winning several Emmys, including the 2013 and 2014 awards for Outstanding Variety Series.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stephen_Colbert_Relationship_Status_Who_is_his_Wife></span>Stephen Colbert Relationship Status; Who is his Wife?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Colbert resides in Montclair, New Jersey, with his wife, <strong>Evelyn McGee-Colbert</strong> whom he married on October 9, 1993. She is the daughter of the prominent Charleston civil litigator <strong>Joseph McGee</strong>, of the firm Buist Moore Smythe McGee.</p><p><strong>Must-See: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Michael Zegen gay?</a></strong></p><p>Evelyn actually met <strong>Jon Stewart,</strong> now a good friend of Colbert, before she met Stephen in 1990.</p><p>Colbert described the first moment he met her as being love at first sight. Moments after they met, they both realized that they had grown up together in Charleston and had many mutual friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecelebscloset.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/f4e39a5c-e8f7-4509-ab10-f7e.gif><p>The duo even worked together in an episode of Strangers with Candy&nbsp;where she appeared as his mother. And she also has an uncredited cameo as a nurse in the series pilot and a credited one in the film as his wife.</p><p>The pair has three children named <strong>Madeleine, Peter, </strong>and <strong>John</strong>. They share great romantic chemistry and commitment towards their relationship and the lovers are living a happy life without any rumors of any breakup or separation.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stephen_Colbert_Wiki-Bio_His_Family_Age_and_Net_Worth></span>Stephen Colbert Wiki-Bio; His Family, Age, and Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Stephen Colbert came into this world as Stephen Tyrone Colbert on May 13, 1964, in Washington, D.C. His nationality is American and ethnicity is Irish.</p><p>His mother is <strong>Lorna Elizabeth (Tuck)</strong> and father is&nbsp;<strong>James William Colbert, Jr.</strong>, a doctor and medical school dean at Yale, Saint Louis University. He is the youngest of the eleven children.</p><p><strong>Don’t Miss:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Is Michael Zegen Married?</a></strong></p><p>He grew up alongside his siblings in <strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong>. Colbert experienced what was likely the defining event of his childhood when his father and two of his brothers passed away in a plane crash.</p><p>Because of the trauma, he grew up as an introvert and found solace in reading, especially science fiction and fantasy novels by authors Like J.R.R. Tolkien.</p><p>But during his college and Second City years, Colbert suffered from bouts of&nbsp;depression&nbsp;and&nbsp;anxiety, for which he took medication. Colbert’s mother died at the age of 92 on June 12, 2013, because of ill health.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Stephen_Colbert_Body_Measurement></span>Stephen Colbert Body Measurement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Height = 1.8 m or 5 feet 11 inches</li><li>Weight = 82 kg</li><li>Age = 54</li><li>Eyes = Brown</li><li>Hair = Black</li></ul><h3>Quick Facts: <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h3><h4>Where is <strong>Stephen Colbert originally from?</strong></h4><p>Washington DC, USA</p><h4>Who are <strong>Stephen Colbert’s parents?</strong></h4><p>Lorna Elizabeth and James William Colbert Jr.</p><h4>What is the nationality of <strong>Stephen Colbert?</strong></h4><p>American</p><h4>Which ethnicity does <strong>Stephen Colbert belong to?</strong></h4><p>Irish</p><h4>How tall is <strong>Stephen Colbert?</strong></h4><p>5 feet 11 inches</p><h4>What is the weight of <strong>Stephen Colbert?</strong></h4><p>82kg</p><h4>What color are <strong>Stephen Colbert’s eyes?</strong></h4><p>Brown</p><h4>Which color hair does <strong>Stephen Colbert have?</strong></h4><p>Black</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qcpJ%2BosrV6wqikaKCfrHquwcKhZKKrXajBprzHnqVmm5%2Bhr6a%2B06xkp52kYsSwvtOhZKSmn6x6qbXSZq6io5lir6q7jJ%2Bmq6ylo7Juv8ClmKuxXZqus7rIp56sZZOWv6ax0WakmqqinrKledainZ5lkaOxbq3Mnqmim5GjerG%2BxKygnZ2emMZufo9rZ2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-is-stephen-colberts-net-worth-know-his-wiki-bio-fortune-salary-earnings-career-married-wife-and-american-presidency-2020.html&text=Stephen%20Colbert%20Married%20Life%20with%20Wife%3b%20Stephen%20Colbert%27s%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Affairs%2c%20Wife%2c%20and%20Re&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-is-stephen-colberts-net-worth-know-his-wiki-bio-fortune-salary-earnings-career-married-wife-and-american-presidency-2020.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-is-stephen-colberts-net-worth-know-his-wiki-bio-fortune-salary-earnings-career-married-wife-and-american-presidency-2020.html&title=Stephen%20Colbert%20Married%20Life%20with%20Wife%3b%20Stephen%20Colbert%27s%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Affairs%2c%20Wife%2c%20and%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-much-is-stephen-colberts-net-worth-know-his-wiki-bio-fortune-salary-earnings-career-married-wife-and-american-presidency-2020.html&title=Stephen%20Colbert%20Married%20Life%20with%20Wife%3b%20Stephen%20Colbert%27s%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Affairs%2c%20Wife%2c%20and%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-is-stephen-colberts-net-worth-know-his-wiki-bio-fortune-salary-earnings-career-married-wife-and-american-presidency-2020.html&title=Stephen%20Colbert%20Married%20Life%20with%20Wife%3b%20Stephen%20Colbert%27s%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Affairs%2c%20Wife%2c%20and%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-is-stephen-colberts-net-worth-know-his-wiki-bio-fortune-salary-earnings-career-married-wife-and-american-presidency-2020.html&description=Stephen%20Colbert%20Married%20Life%20with%20Wife%3b%20Stephen%20Colbert%27s%20Wiki-Bio%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Affairs%2c%20Wife%2c%20and%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-james-a-michener-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is James A.
