芸能人格付けチェックですが、
毎年注目されるのはGacktさんの連勝記録です。
ペアとしての連勝記録は途絶えたものの、
Gacktさん個人の正解記録はずっと続いてます。
そんなGacktさんの格付けチェックの相方は、
毎年注目されますが、過去には魔裟斗さんや堀江貴文さんなど、
各界の大物が選ばれることが多くありました。
そして来年２０１８年１月１日放送の、
格付けチェックのGacktさんの相方が、
まさかまさかのYOSHIKIさんに決定したのです！
毎年元旦にテレビ朝日・朝日放送系で放送される「芸能人格付けチェック！」で連勝記録を伸ばし続けるＧＡＣＫＴの２０１８年パートナーに、ＸＪＡＰＡＮのＹＯＳＨＩＫＩが決まったことが１２日、分かった。ＸＡＪＡＰＮのドキュメンタリー映画「ＷＥＡＲＥＸ」公式ツイッターで発表された。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20171212-00000032-dal-ent
しかも公表した先が、
YOSHIKIさん側というのも意外！
これはGacktさんファンだけでなく、
Xファンにとっても劇的な朗報です！
ずっと仲良しだった二人のペアですが、
地上波では２００５年のHEY!HEY!HEY!以来でしょうか？
ネット番組の中では、
YOSHIKIさんとGacktさんが共演することは多いですが・・・。
番組の中で喧嘩とかしないか心配です、
仮にも兄弟のような二人ですから、
互いのファンがやきもちした心境で見守ることでしょう。
YOSHIKIが格付けに登場！Gacktの2018年の相方は親友ミュージシャン GacktさんとYOSHIKIさんが仲良しなのは、
周知のことだと思いますが、
具体的にどのような空気感で接しているのか、
そのリアルな仲が気になります。
格付けチェックはGacktさんにとっては、
非常に重要なイベントでもありますが、
当然、本気で挑むことでしょう。
過去に本気のステージの裏で、
揉めてしまった過去があるだけに、
この格付けでの二人の仲の行方が気になります。
そして、この日「ＷＥＡＲＥＸ」公式ツイッターで「『芸能人格付けチェック！これぞ真の一流品だ！２０１８正月スペシャル』に最強チーム『ＹＯＳＨＩＫＩ＆ＧＡＣＫＴ』が登場！最強チームで、絶対に間違えられない戦いに挑みます。どうぞお楽しみに！」の告知が。
これにはファンは熱狂。「ＹＯＳＨＩＫＩ＆ＧＡＣＫＴはやばすぎ！」「凄すぎ！」「最高最強かよ！」「どうしたって期待しちゃう」など早くも元旦への期待感が沸騰していた。引用元：https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20171212-00000032-dal-ent
GacktさんとYOSHIKIさんが、
共通して強いのはワインの問題だと思います。
YOSHIKIさんは基本的にシャンパンを好みますが、
ワインの味にだって精通しています。
これまでワインの問題はGacktさんが挑んでいましたが、
今回は、初めてYOSHIKIさんを信用して任せる可能性もあります。
さらに言えばクラシック音楽やジャズの問題も、
YOSHIKIさんがいれば最強と言えることでしょう。
もっと言えば、生まれも育ちも良いYOSHIKIさんだけに、
盆栽などの高貴な問題にも強そうです。
ある意味Gacktさんの弱点を補えそうに思えます。
しかし、ワインも音楽も強い二人が、
仮に意見が割れてしまったら、
どちらかが譲ることができるのか？
そこが一番怖いところです。
YOSHIKIさんもGacktさんもプライドが高く、
どちらも譲らない性格なので、
得意分野で答えが別れないことを祈りましょう。
・・・流石にYOSHIKIさんクラスなら、
Gacktさんが譲る場面もありえそうですが、
仮にそれで正解したら、格付け史上最高の名場面になることでしょう。
SKIN再結成と友情・関係(画像・動画) YOSHIKIさんとGacktさんと言えば、
やはり２００７年のスキンの活動が気になります。
二人の各方面の話を聞いてる限りは、
今後やる予定はないが、プロジェクトは生きてるそうです。
この前のネット方法の中で、
YOSHIKIさんの方からGacktさんに、
スキンの話をしていたのが意外でした。
そして、その時のGacktさんの、
やや複雑な表情が・・・・。</description></item><item><title>Hilarie Burton News - Us Weekly</title><link>/hilarie-burton.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/hilarie-burton.html</guid><description>Sign In with your social account
