The video features the words <strong>“Beautiful Man. Both inside and out”</strong> and the song <strong>“Sweet Love”</strong> by Anita Baker playing in the background.&nbsp;</p><p>Thousands of fans have expressed their condolences to Judge Toler following the announcement</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Eric Mumford?</h2><p>Born in Ohio on January 1, 1951, Eric was a proud husband, father, and grandfather. He met Lynn in 1986, and their <a href=#>relationship</a> blossomed into a 33-year-long marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>He met the love of his life, Lynn Toler, in 1986. After a year of dating and a two-year engagement, the couple exchanged vows and embarked on a journey of love and companionship.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the course of their marriage, Eric and Lynn built a beautiful family, having two children, William and Xavier, of their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric was also a proud father to four sons from his previous marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite keeping a low profile, Eric was a constant presence in Lynn’s life, making occasional appearances on her Instagram and offering a glimpse into the personal world of the beloved TV judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A former accountant, Eric lived a quiet life but was widely loved by all who knew him. His sudden death left Lynn and many others in pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>Lynn Toler, a renowned lawyer and author of Doing Marriage Work, is best known for her 13-year hosting role on the popular television series Divorce Court.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her fame, little is known about her husband, Eric Mumford, affectionately referred to as “Big E” by Toler.&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Toler shared Lynn and Eric’s <a href=#>relationship</a> journey on their 33rd anniversary, where she acknowledged the ups and downs but emphasized the importance of the journey.&nbsp;</p><p>In an op-ed in 2017, Lynn talked about her relationship with Eric and revealed how Divorce Court helped save their marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the show’s exaggerated and “voyeuristic” appearance, it played a critical role in getting their relationship back on track during a rough patch in its 19th year.</p><p>Judge Lynn Toler, who served as the host of the TV series Divorce Court for 13 years, learned a valuable lesson about marriage while on the job.&nbsp;</p><p>Lynn Toler and Eric Mumford’s marriage faced challenges by year 19. They barely communicated and avoided each other.&nbsp;</p><p>Eric was angry and depressed and blamed Lynn for everything, while Lynn saw him as inconsiderate and unresponsive to her needs.&nbsp;</p><p>She wrote that the cases she encountered made her realize the importance of communication and overcoming insecurities.&nbsp;</p><p>She and her husband, Eric Mumford, took the time to understand each other’s perspectives and work through their problems, which helped them maintain a long-lasting marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this, Toler acknowledges that marriage is a journey with changes along the way, but they have consciously tried to stay committed to each other.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC21J2enmWcrruvedOoo56qXZ3CtK7Ap5tmqJikwbB7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjudge-lynn-toler-husband-photo.html&text=Judge%20Lynn%20Tolers%20Husbands%20Photo%20%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjudge-lynn-toler-husband-photo.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjudge-lynn-toler-husband-photo.html&title=Judge%20Lynn%20Tolers%20Husbands%20Photo%20%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjudge-lynn-toler-husband-photo.html&title=Judge%20Lynn%20Tolers%20Husbands%20Photo%20%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjudge-lynn-toler-husband-photo.html&title=Judge%20Lynn%20Tolers%20Husbands%20Photo%20%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjudge-lynn-toler-husband-photo.html&description=Judge%20Lynn%20Tolers%20Husbands%20Photo%20%20What%20Happened%20To%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./update-wyatt-kelce-video-celebrating-wyatt-kelces-birthday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Update Wyatt Kelce video: Celebrating Wyatt Kelces Birthday">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./height-and-all-you-need-to-know-about-jeff-cavaliere-the-athlean-x-guy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Height and all you need to know about Jeff Cavaliere the Athlean X guy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
