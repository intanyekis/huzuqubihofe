Real's reserve team - play in the Spanish league system and actually won the third-tier title in the 2011/12 campaign, where they instantly impressed in the Segunda Division.</p><p>Castilla finished in a respectable eighth, above ninth-place Barcelona B, with striker Jese Rodriguez banging in 22 goals.</p><p>Brazilian midfielders Casemiro and Fabinho were crucial members of the team.</p><p>But just one of the pair carved out a lengthy career at the Bernabeu - a decision the Spanish giants would later regret.</p><p>Real showed ruthlessness in selling the majority of their starlets, with few being given the chance to shine for the first team.</p><p>Here, talkSPORT.com looks at the highest-profile players from the 2013 Castilla squad and what they have achieved in the game.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in football</h2></p><h4>Casemiro</h4><p>The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>31-year-old</a> joined Real's second team in 2013 on loan from Sao Paulo midway through the season, where he quickly became an integral part of the team.</p><p>After 15 league appearances, Real turned his temporary stay into a permanent switch with the player promoted to the first team for the following season.</p><p>A loan spell to Porto followed in the 2014/15 campaign, before he established himself as a key player for Real - featuring 336 times in all competitions prior to his switch to <a href=#>Manchester United</a> last summer.</p><p>Casemiro won five Champions League crowns with Real along with three LaLiga titles, and is considered one of the club's best-ever defensive midfielders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/casemiro-real-madrid-controls-ball-799234793.jpg><h4>Fabinho</h4><p>Like his compatriot, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fabinho</a> joined on loan from Rio Ave for the 202/13 term, where he appeared in 30 matches.</p><p>His fine form saw him being given an opportunity for the first team in May 2013 in a 6-2 win against Malaga in what remains his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only appearance for the senior side</a>.</p><p>Real opted against permanently signing him, where he then joined Monaco - helping them win the Ligue 1 title in 2017.</p><p>It resulted in a move to Liverpool, where he has won six major trophies to establish himself as one of Europe's top players in his position.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/fabinho-real-madrid-cf-action-326092765.jpg><h4>Alvaro Morata</h4><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Morata</a> scored 12 goals in 18 Segunda Division games which saw him promoted to the first team.</p><p>But after just ten goals across two LaLiga seasons, he was sold to Juventus where he won back-to-back Serie A titles, while spearheading the Old Lady to the Champions League final in 2015 where he scored in the 3-1 final defeat against Barcelona.</p><p>Incredibly, Morata scored in both semi-final legs against Real to dump the defending champions out of the European Cup.</p><p>His dazzling displays in Italy saw Real bring him back to the Bernabeu in a £26.3million deal - scoring 20 goals in 43 games to help his side win the LaLiga and Champions League.</p><p>After just one year back in Spain, he was sold to Chelsea for £60m, but failed to hit the heights expected of him.</p><p>Atletico Madrid swooped in to secure his services in January 2019, before he was loaned to Juve in 2020 for a second spell in Turin.</p><p>He returned to Atletico last summer, with the 30-year-old banging in seven LaLiga goals this season from 23 outings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/01/morata_0.jpg><h4>Lucas Vazquez</h4><p>The versatile Spaniard started off his career as a right winger for Castilla, with the 31-year-old now operating as a right-back.</p><p>After three years with Castilla, Vazquez was loaned to Espanyol in 2014 where he featured in 39 games in all competitions.</p><p>Since coming back for the 2015/16 season, Vazquez has been an important player for Real where he has appeared in 297 games.</p><p>Often used as a back-up for Dani Carvajal, Vazquez has never finished a campaign with less than 23 outings for his boyhood club.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/07/GettyImages-1091935474.jpg><h4>Nacho</h4><p>The centre-back was Castilla's skipper, with the 33-year-old now Real's vice-captain after being promoted to first team duty in 2013.</p><p>Despite having 301 appearances to his name for the senior side, Nacho has often found himself out of the starting XI.</p><p>Over the years, Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane, Eder Militao and Pepe have all been preferred ahead of the 22-cap Spain international.</p><p>But his love for Real has never seen Nacho kick up a fuss or seek a new adventure from the team he has been at since 2001.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/nacho-fernandez-real-madrid-cf-798554521.jpg><h4>Jese Rodriguez</h4><p>Considered to be Real's golden boy, Jese broke Emilio Butragueno's 29-year record by scoring the most goals in a single season for the reserve team.</p><p>After being promoted, Jese became a regular for the first team, where he scored 18 goals in 94 matches in all competitions.</p><p>But he struggled for consistency having been used as a bench player, with Paris Saint-Germain snapping him up for £21.9m in 2016.</p><p>It turned out to be a disaster of a move, with Las Palmas bringing him back to Spain on loan just months later.</p><p>A loan switch to then-Premier League side Stoke followed, but he ultimately flopped in England after scoring just once from 13 top-flight outings.</p><p>PSG then shipped Jese off to Real Betis and Sporting Lisbon, before Las Palmas re-signed him.</p><p>Jese then made the move to Turkey last year to join newly-promoted MKE Ankaragucu, but he failed to settle, with the 30-year-old joining Italian outfit Sampdoria earlier this month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/04/jese.jpg><h4>Jota</h4><p>Just like Casemiro and Fabihno, Jota was brought to Castilla on loan, but he didn't impress Real enough to sign him on a permanent deal.</p><p>He instead starred on loan at Eibar from Celta Vigo, with Brentford snapping him up in 2014, with playmaker Jota banging in 11 goals in his opening season in the Championship.</p><p>A fan favourite with the Bees, injuries limited the 31-year-old's game time, where he returned to Eibar on an 18-month loan in January 2016.</p><p>Birmingham then splashed out a club-record £6m to bring him back to England in 2017, where he then joined fierce rivals Aston Villa in a shock transfer two years later following their promotion to the Premier League.</p><p>In doing so, he reunited with ex-Brentford boss Dean Smith, but he couldn't replicate the same form that earned him the move to Villa Park, as he failed to score in any of his ten top-flight matches.</p><p>After a solitary season with Deportivo Alaves, Jota announced his decision to retire in 2021 - citing a lack of 'ambition' after falling out of love with football.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT000508265674-e1565355137612.jpg><h4>Diego Llorente</h4><p>The defender made just one Castilla appearance in the 2012/13 season after being promoted from Real Madrid C.</p><p>He was a regular in the team over the next two campaigns, while he also made two senior appearances for the first team.</p><p>Loan spells to Rayo Vallecano and Malaga followed, before he was allowed to join Real Sociedad on a permanent deal.</p><p>His performances led Leeds to sign him for £18m in 2020, but he slowly started to fall down the pecking under Marcelo Bielsa and then Jesse Marsch.</p><p>Roma offered him an escape from his Elland Road nightmare in the winter transfer window, with Jose Mourinho's club completing a loan deal with an option to buy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/diego-llorente-leeds-united-teemu-704726364-1.jpg><h4>Derik Osede</h4><p>Another ex-Castilla star that ended up in England, the 30-year-old made 11 appearances in the 2012/13 season.</p><p>Partnering Llorente in the heart of the defence until 2015, Real decided against offering Derik a new deal.</p><p>He subsequently joined Bolton on a free transfer, where he was part of the squad that was relegated to the Championship, before earning promotion from League One at the first time of asking.</p><p>After 71 outings for the Trotters, he returned to Spain to join Numancia, before linking up with Deportivo La Coruna.</p><p>He currently plays for third-tier side Pontevedra CF, who are in danger of relegation as they sit bottom of the table after 25 games.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/derik-osede-real-madrid-castilla-799251243.jpg><h4>Raul de Tomas</h4><p>Real's Castilla side of 2013 boasted a wealth of attacking talent, with De Tomas another striker that came through the club's academy.</p><p>De Tomas, who scored 14 goals for Castilla, was given a first team run-out in the Copa del Rey in October 2014.</p><p>It remains his only outing for the senior side, with the 28-year-old sold to Benfica for £17.5m in 2019 after starring on loan at Cordoba, Real Valladolid and Vallecano.</p><p>Espanyol then splashed out the same fee to bring him back to Spain six months later, where he scored 45 goals in 89 games.</p><p>He re-joined Vallecano in January, but is still awaiting his first goal of the season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/raul-de-tomas-rayo-vallecano-797007441.jpg><h4>Denis Cheryshev</h4><p>The Russian winger banged in 22 goals in 109 games for Castilla - with 11 of his strikes coming in the 2012/13 term.</p><p>But he was never given a chance to impress for Los Blancos' first team, after being limited to just seven games.</p><p>Cheryshev was offloaded on loan three times, with Sevilla, Villarreal and Valencia all benefitting from his arrival.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>He finally left Real for Villarreal in 2016, before returning to Valencia - where he stayed until last summer.</p><p>After spending his entire career in Spain, the 32-year-old made the move to Italy where he linked up with Serie B outfit Spezia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2013/09/denis_cheryshev-crop.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/02/talksport-2022-league-table-top-6-89ad195d-97d6-452f-a09e-7611ad074224.png><h3><strong>Follow all the latest <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://talksport.com/football/premier-league/fixtures/>Premier League fixtures and results HERE on talkSPORT.com</a></strong></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifKe7zq2ZmqScZH50gJVubmxnopqurXnMmpuroZRisKK%2F06KjpZldmK60scyiqahllpavqrrHqGSmmZ5iwrWwjKWgr52ipbywuI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2freal-madrid-castilla-casemiro-fabinho-man-utd-liverpool.html&text=Casemiro%2c%20Fabinho%2c%20Alvaro%20Morata%20and%20Lucas%20Vazquez%20-%20Real%20Madrid%27s%20Castilla%202013%20team%20has%20provided%20M&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freal-madrid-castilla-casemiro-fabinho-man-utd-liverpool.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2freal-madrid-castilla-casemiro-fabinho-man-utd-liverpool.html&title=Casemiro%2c%20Fabinho%2c%20Alvaro%20Morata%20and%20Lucas%20Vazquez%20-%20Real%20Madrid%27s%20Castilla%202013%20team%20has%20provided%20M" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2freal-madrid-castilla-casemiro-fabinho-man-utd-liverpool.html&title=Casemiro%2c%20Fabinho%2c%20Alvaro%20Morata%20and%20Lucas%20Vazquez%20-%20Real%20Madrid%27s%20Castilla%202013%20team%20has%20provided%20M" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2freal-madrid-castilla-casemiro-fabinho-man-utd-liverpool.html&title=Casemiro%2c%20Fabinho%2c%20Alvaro%20Morata%20and%20Lucas%20Vazquez%20-%20Real%20Madrid%27s%20Castilla%202013%20team%20has%20provided%20M" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freal-madrid-castilla-casemiro-fabinho-man-utd-liverpool.html&description=Casemiro%2c%20Fabinho%2c%20Alvaro%20Morata%20and%20Lucas%20Vazquez%20-%20Real%20Madrid%27s%20Castilla%202013%20team%20has%20provided%20M" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dwyane-wades-son-zaires-relationship-with-bronny-james-future-nba-champions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dwyane Wade's Son Zaire's Relationship With Bronny James Transcends Being Future NBA Champions">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bad-bunny-shares-a-smooch-with-male-backup-dancer-during-his-2022-vma-performance-aumag.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bad Bunny shares a smooch with male backup dancer during his 2022 VMA performance  Aumag The Talk">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
