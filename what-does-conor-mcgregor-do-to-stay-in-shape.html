The man just exudes confidence, has that fighter mentality ingrained within him. It’s what helped him climb through the ranks of the UFC and become one of the best and most recognizable fighters, sportsmen in general for that matter, in history. Even those who aren’t really into the UFC know Conor’s name. He’s that type of character, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has that star quality</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>MMA fighters are recognized as the fittest people on the planet. But even amongst the current crop of starfighters, Conor McGregor stands out, is of a different breed. That’s in part due to his fighting ability, his MMA skills. But it’s also because of his mindset and his level of fitness, the approach he takes to training and getting ready for fights. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He’s a physical specimen, is always in prime shape </a>whenever he’s getting ready to unleash hell on his opponents in the Octagon. But what does Conor McGregor actually do to get and stay in shape? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id=drinks-plenty-of-water><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Drinks Plenty Of Water</span></h2><p>The first thing Conor does when he wakes up in the morning is to drink plenty of water. He drinks lots of water throughout the day too, but he downs a few glasses as soon as he wakes up. This gets the system firing, the machine in motion ready for the day ahead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-a-stretching-routine><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Has A Stretching Routine</span></h2><p>As an MMA fighter, stretching is an essential component of a training regime. Conor’s got to keep subtle and limber, has got to keep flexible and in good shape in order to be able to carry out all of his moves, throw different combinations without issue. Conor spends a good amount of time stretching before any training session.</p><h2 id=stays-active-is-continuously-moving-throughout-the-day><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Stays Active, Is Continuously Moving Throughout The Day</span></h2><p>This may sound rather basic, but as Conor would testify, it really helps. He’s said that from the moment he gets up in the morning, he’s up and about and is always moving. Whether that involves a gym session, doing an MMA class, partaking in a spot of yoga, or <a href=#>playing with the kids</a>, he’s always doing something, and that energy expenditure helps keep him fit and trim.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freind Or Foe? Here's Who Conor McGregor Likes And Dislikes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=focusses-on-flexibility><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Focusses On Flexibility</span></h2><p>As an MMA fighter, Conor’s got to stay flexible. Sure, speed and strength are also key. But Conor puts a great deal of focus on his flexibility. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He’s said that MMA has become too much about “lifting heavy weights and sparring heavy rounds.”</a> Conor doesn’t exclude such training from his regime. But he’s more interested in flexibility and functionality.</p><h2 id=partakes-in-yoga><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Partakes In Yoga</span></h2><p>Conor leaves no stone unturned in his quest to being the best and staying on his pedestal. While most fighters would leave out yoga in preference of a weight session or some sparring, Conor recognizes the benefits of yoga. It helps with his flexibility, that mind-muscle connection, and it also helps from a psychological standpoint, helps Conor remain still from within.</p><h2 id=sparring><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sparring</span></h2><p>Sparring is an integral part of any fighter’s training regime. Conor might spend a lot of time focussing on his flexibility and pounding out grueling sessions in the gym. But in the lead up to a fight, when it comes to honing those skills, there’s nothing better than sparring. Conor does sparring throughout the year but amps up the rounds when there’s a fight on the horizon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=takes-a-martial-arts-class><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Takes A Martial Arts Class</span></h2><p>Conor might be one of the most recognizable faces in the fight game in the world. But he’s by no means an expert martial artist. He wants to improve and hone his existing skills at the same time, and so Conor’s not above bowing down before his teachers and taking martial arts classes.</p><h2 id=trains-with-different-people><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Trains With Different People</span></h2><p>Training with the same people day in and day out only exposes you to so many things. Conor’s going to get into the Octagon with a different person every fight, and every one of his opponents is going to have a different skillset. So, it’s necessary for Conor to expose himself to different fighters in sparring, pick up certain tips from a variety of individuals.</p><h2 id=doesn-t-believe-in-a-regimented-approach><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Doesn’t Believe In A Regimented Approach</span></h2><p>Different athletes approach their days differently. Some prefer a regimented approach. But Conor wakes up not really knowing what he’s going to do. He does whatever takes his fancy. He might do a bit of light training in the gym, do a spot of yoga, and then do a martial arts class. He’s at a stage in his life where it’s up to him. It keeps it fresh for him too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=focusses-on-those-core-compound-exercises><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Focusses On Those Core Compound Exercises</span></h2><p>Conor pays a great deal of attention to his flexibility. But occasionally he’ll hit the gym for a weight session. When he does, he makes sure he gets those big compound movements into his routine. He’ll always incorporate squats, deadlifts, and bench-press exercises into his workouts, as they help with his strength and enable him to pack on quality muscle.</p><h2 id=locomotion-conditioning><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Locomotion Conditioning</span></h2><p>A big part of Conor’s flexibility training involves locomotion conditioning. It’s deemed to be better than cardio, as it stimulates the cardiovascular system in addition to keeping the body strong and mobile. Locomotion condition involves exercises such as the duck walk, horse walk, bear crawl, monkey crawl, etc. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all of which are a big part of Conor’s training regime</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Rumors Conor McGregor Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=using-the-elements><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Using The Elements</span></h2><p>Conor engages in a lot of strenuous activity. Swimming’s a little kinder on his body. A lot of top athletes have taken to the pool, are doing more and more swimming and aerobics in the water, and Conor’s no exception. But a hard man like Conor doesn’t reserve these exercises for the pool. He takes things up a notch by training in the open water, under the elements, under the great Irish sky.</p><h2 id=his-nutrition-s-on-point><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>His Nutrition’s On Point</span></h2><p>There are three things that make a great athlete, a trident that those who work out follow, or should anyway. There’s the training, the rest and recovery, and of course, nutrition. Nutrition is arguably the most important of the three. There’s no point punishing the body through grueling workouts if the muscles don’t have adequate nutrition to recover and grow, get stronger.</p><p>Sources - The Sun, BleacherReport</p><p style=text-align:center><span class=next-single>NEXT:</span></p><p style=text-align:center><span class=next-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He Bought What? 15 Of Conor McGregor's Most Ridiculous Purchases</a></span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGwsdJmmqimn6d6rq%2FGq5ygp6JisbB506hkrKyRrnqquoysn5qolWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-conor-mcgregor-do-to-stay-in-shape.html&text=What%20Does%20Conor%20McGregor%20Do%20To%20Stay%20In%20Shape%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-conor-mcgregor-do-to-stay-in-shape.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-conor-mcgregor-do-to-stay-in-shape.html&title=What%20Does%20Conor%20McGregor%20Do%20To%20Stay%20In%20Shape%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-conor-mcgregor-do-to-stay-in-shape.html&title=What%20Does%20Conor%20McGregor%20Do%20To%20Stay%20In%20Shape%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-conor-mcgregor-do-to-stay-in-shape.html&title=What%20Does%20Conor%20McGregor%20Do%20To%20Stay%20In%20Shape%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-conor-mcgregor-do-to-stay-in-shape.html&description=What%20Does%20Conor%20McGregor%20Do%20To%20Stay%20In%20Shape%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whitney-ports-complicated-relationship-with-food-what-shes-said.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whitney Port's Complicated Relationship With Food: What She's Said">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./singer-adam-mac-cancels-music-festival-set-after-alleged-homophobia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Singer Adam Mac Cancels Music Festival Set After Alleged Homophobia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
