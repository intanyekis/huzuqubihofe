Misty was interested in beach volleyball from the very young age as her parents often played this game. May-Treanor’s first tournament was when she was only eight years old. Despite the fact that Misty was very interested in beach volleyball she as well practiced other sports such as soccer and tennis. What is more, she also attended dancing classes. While attending Newport Harbor High School, Misty played volleyball and won two state championships. During Misty’s years at college she also continued to play volleyball. Misty’s skills were noticed and she was included into the Hall of Fame of the Long Beach State Athletics. After finishing Long Beach State, Misty became a part of U.S. Women’s National Volleyball Team. Soon after joining it, she left U.S Women’s National Volleyball Team and began her career as beach volleyball player. Exactly while playing beach volleyball Misty won medal in Summer Olympics. It not only gained her more popularity and acclaim but also affected Misty May-Treanor’s net worth. Another decision that made Misty’s net worth higher was her teaming up with Walsh Jennings.
