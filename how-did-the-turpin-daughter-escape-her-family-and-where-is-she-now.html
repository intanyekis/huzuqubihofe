While there is nothing wrong with enjoying true crime content, it could be argued that there is a dark side to that. After all the popularity of true crime content and <a href=#>shows that glamorize being connected to wrongdoers like Mob Wives</a> can make it easy for people to be desensitized to the worst things in life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Kevin O'Leary’s Wife Got Away With An Incredibly Serious Crime</a></span></p><p>When the world learned about how David and Louise Turpin had treated their children, a lot of the coverage centered on their misdeeds. While it is important to remember what happened to the Turpin family so that everyone can keep an eye out for kids who might be going through the same things, the kids’ future matters more. For that reason, everyone should focus more on the amazing story of one of the Turpin children who saved all of her siblings and where she is now.</p><h2 id=what-happened-in-the-turpin-house-of-horrors>What Happened In The Turpin House Of Horrors?</h2><p>Even though this article isn’t primarily focused on how the Turpin children were treated before they were rescued, it is important to touch on what happened for full context. Between 1988 and 2015, David and Louise Turpin had thirteen children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariel Winter & Other Celebs Who Feuded With Their Own Parents</a></span></p><p>Although the Turpin children were sometimes allowed out and they were even taken to Disneyland once, they spent almost all of their time indoors. Worse yet, David and Louise Turpin never provided their children with enough food. As a result, the Turpin children were severely malnourished when they were rescued with an 11-year-old having the same arm circumference as a 4-month-old baby. On top of being malnourished, the Turpin children were habitually beaten, strangled, and even chained to their beds sometimes for weeks at a time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-jordan-turpin-saved-her-siblings>How Jordan Turpin Saved Her Siblings</h2><p>Ever since the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> debuted in theaters, it has reigned supreme at the box office because people love seeing their favorite superheroes on the big screen. While there is nothing wrong with that since comic book films can be extremely entertaining, it is a shame that people don’t focus more on real-life superheroes like Jordan Turpin.</p><p>By the time Jordan Turpin turned 17 years old, she had gone so many years without proper nutrition that she was incredibly undersized and weak. On top of that, Jordan had spent her entire life fearing her parents David and Louise since she knew that there would be severe consequences if she angered them. Despite all of that, Jordan decided to save all of her siblings when she was only 17-years-old.</p><p>On January 14th, 2018, Jordan Turpin and her younger sister who was 13-years-old escaped their parents' clutches through a window. Sadly, the 13-year-old had been so terrorized by David and Louise Turpin that she was incredibly frightened even after escaping which is why she climbed back in the window. Determined to save herself and her siblings, Jordan went on alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Awesome Vigilantes That Really Fight Crime</a></span></p><p>Able to escape with a deactivated cell phone, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan Turpin was able to use it to call 911</a> since devices that don’t have a plan can still call that number. After being connected to the local police, Jordan told them about the hell that she and her siblings had been put through by their parents. Shortly after, police performed a welfare check at the Turpin home and discovered a house reeking of human excrement, decaying garbage, dead pets, and molding food, with every surface covered in trash. More importantly, police arrested David and Louise Turpin and saved all of their children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-jordan-turpin-and-her-siblings-are-now>Where Jordan Turpin And Her Siblings Are Now</h2><p>Two years after Jordan Turpin saved her siblings, Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Kevin Beecham gave People an update on them. “They are moving on with their lives." Later on, the adult siblings’ lawyer Jack Osborn put out a statement about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how the recently freed Turpins dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. "Covid-19 makes it challenging but they're in school and just living normal lives. They grew up not going outside. It's weird for them now, but it's something they're doing OK with."</p><p>After other people spoke for them, Jordan and Jennifer Turpin agreed to be interviewed for a 2021 20/20 special. Later interviewed by Good Morning America about the 20/20 special, the raw emotions that the sisters felt about reliving their experiences were palpable. Sadly, Jordan Turpin also revealed that after escaping their parents, she and her siblings found themselves in another bad situation they’d recently freed themselves from as well. Fortunately, however, the sisters revealed that all of the Turpin siblings are in a better place now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the Good Morning America interview, Jordan Turpin was open that she was still struggling to heal and find her place in the world. Amazingly enough, however, Jordan revealed that she wanted to become a motivational speaker. The reason for that is that Jordan wanted to use her story to “help others” because “if [she] can use what I went through to make a difference in the world, then [she] thinks that can heal [her].” Clearly, Jordan has grown into an incredibly strong and selfless person despite her upbringing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Josh Duggar, Abby Lee Miller And 8 Other Reality TV Stars Convicted Of Crimes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbaledOhnGaspae9qrqMnZiun5ipsrN5xKyamqiVYrWmvoyfmKahnK56orrDZq6hnaKaeqq%2FjKyfnmWepMRw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-the-turpin-daughter-escape-her-family-and-where-is-she-now.html&text=How%20Did%20The%20Turpin%20Daughter%20Escape%20Her%20Family%20And%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-the-turpin-daughter-escape-her-family-and-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-the-turpin-daughter-escape-her-family-and-where-is-she-now.html&title=How%20Did%20The%20Turpin%20Daughter%20Escape%20Her%20Family%20And%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-the-turpin-daughter-escape-her-family-and-where-is-she-now.html&title=How%20Did%20The%20Turpin%20Daughter%20Escape%20Her%20Family%20And%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-the-turpin-daughter-escape-her-family-and-where-is-she-now.html&title=How%20Did%20The%20Turpin%20Daughter%20Escape%20Her%20Family%20And%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-the-turpin-daughter-escape-her-family-and-where-is-she-now.html&description=How%20Did%20The%20Turpin%20Daughter%20Escape%20Her%20Family%20And%20Where%20Is%20She%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-kidero-distributed-his-over-ksh-30-million-payout-to-hon-shebesh-after-the-slap.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Kidero Distributed His Over Ksh 30 Million Payout to Hon Shebesh After the Slap">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ethan-simmons-patterson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ethan Simmons Patterson - Vulture">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
