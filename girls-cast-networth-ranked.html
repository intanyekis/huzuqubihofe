Many of them had their breakout TV roles on the series, while some were already big names on the theater circuit. And others, still, have gone on to do big things, including appearing in Oscar-winning films.</p><p>Here’s the net worth of the 10 main cast members, with most data coming from CelebrityNetWorth.com.</p><h2 id=lena-dunham---12-million><strong>Lena Dunham - $12 million</strong></h2><p>Dunham not only starred in the HBO series as the lead character Hannah, but she&nbsp;also served as the writer, director, producer, and creator. Naturally, this earned her big coin through the series’ six-season run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has written other projects as well, including the semi-autobiographical independent film Tiny Furniture, which earned her an Independent Spirit Award. Considered by Time magazine to be one of the most 100 influential people in the world back in 2013 at the height of Girls’ fame, she has also authored books and has appeared in a number of films. She most recently had a role in American Horror Story: Cult.</p><h2 id=allison-williams---2-million><strong>Allison Williams - $2 million</strong></h2><p>The daughter of famous former NBC news anchor Brian Williams, this 31-year-old had her breakout role in this series, where she played Marnie, <a href=#>the best friend of Dunham’s character</a>.</p><p>Also a singer, she wrote a series of Funny or Die sketches and appeared as a recurring character in the CollegeHumor series Jake and Amir.</p><p>Her most notable projects since Girls ended have been as Peter Pan in Peter Pan Live!, which aired on NBC in 2014, starring in the Oscar-winning film Get Out in 2017, and appearing in the Netflix horror film The Perfection.</p><h2 id=jemima-kirke---3-million><strong>Jemima Kirke - $3 million</strong></h2><p>This English-American artist and actress, who played Jessa on the show, also starred in Dunham’s independent film Tiny Furniture. This, however, was done as a favor to Dunham, her childhood friend, and thus it didn’t contribute to her overall earnings. She also starred in the indie short film Smile for the Camera, and has appeared in several music videos, including Zayn’s “Dusk Till Dawn.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kirke paints and held her own art show in 2017-2018 featuring portrait-style paintings. She considers herself an artist first.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 15 Dumbest Plot Lines On Sex And The City</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=adam-driver---10-million><strong>Adam Driver - $10 million</strong></h2><p>The most high-profile of the actors from the series, aside from Dunham, Driver gained a lot of attention following his role as Adam on Girls, securing roles like <a href=#>Kylo Ren in the Star Wars sequel trilogy</a> films and in BlacKkKlansman, which earned him an Academy Award nomination.</p><p>He also does work on Broadway, most recently in Burn This, for which he received a Tony Award nomination. In addition to his acting work, Driver also co-founded the non-profit Arts in the Armed Forces that brings arts programming to active duty service members, veterans, military support staff, and their families. Driver, himself, served in the U.S. Marine Corps for two years.</p><h2 id=zosia-mamet---3-million><strong>Zosia Mamet - $3 million</strong></h2><p>An actress and musician, Mamet is known mostly from her role as Shoshanna in Girls, as well as small roles in Mad Men, United States of Tara, and Parenthood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From an acting family – her grandfather was a playwright, mother an actor, and father a playwright, screenwriter, and film director, Mamet also has her own band called Chacha, and has done voice acting for audiobooks. She most recently appeared in a recurring role in Netflix’s Armistead Maupin’s Taste of the City, a drama based on the novel series.</p><h2 id=alex-karpovsky-under-review><strong>Alex Karpovsky – Under Review</strong></h2><p>The net worth of this director, actor, screenwriter, producer, and film editor, who played the coffee shop manager Ray on the series, is not widely publicized and considered to be “under review.”</p><p>His most notable role since Girls was in the Amazon Prime Video series Homecoming, starring opposite Julia Roberts. He has released a number of films, including independent and feature-length, and directed an episode of Girls and one of Love. He earns additional cash through reading stories for live and radio audiences, and has apparently done hundreds of these, including NPR’s Selected Shorts and The New York Times’ Modern Love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Photos Of Lena Dunham That Make It Look Like She Lives In Her Car&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id=andrew-rannells---4-million><strong>Andrew Rannells - $4 million</strong></h2><p>Playing Elijah on the series, Rannells is best known as <a href=#>a theater actor</a>, having appeared in a number of productions, including The Book of Mormon and in the 2016 revival of Falsettos, receiving Tony nominations for both roles. He has also appeared in a number of other high-profile Broadway productions, including Hairspray, Hamilton, and Jersey Boys.</p><p>Rannells has also padded his wallet through voice work, and has appeared in movies like Bachelorette and in TV series like Black Monday. He has several new projects in the works.</p><h2 id=ebon-moss-bachrach---1--5-million-under-review><strong>Ebon Moss-Bachrach - $1-$5 million (Under Review)</strong></h2><p>The newest cast member on the list, having joined as a recurring character in season 3 and main in the final three seasons, Moss-Bachrach played Desi, the <a href=#>troubled boyfriend and later husband</a> of Williams’ character. He is also known for playing David Lieberman in The Punisher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With bit parts in a number of movies dating back to 2001, including in The Royal Tenenbaums, The Lake House, and, most recently, the 2019 film Lying and Stealing, and TV series since 1999, like Law & Order: Criminal Intent, Fringe, and Damages, Moss-Bachrach has also appeared in several small theater productions. Since he's only recently had break-out roles, however, his net worth is still under review.</p><h2 id=peter-scolari---2-million><strong>Peter Scolari - $2 million</strong></h2><p>Playing Hannah’s father Tad, Scolari has a long acting resume to his credit, including on Newhart and Bosom Buddies in the ‘80s, receiving three Emmy nominations for his work on the former series.</p><p>Appearing on Girls in a recurring role throughout the entire series run, Scolari has also worked on Broadway, including most notably playing The Wizard in Wicked. Interestingly, he reunited with his Bosom Buddies co-star Tom Hanks for the play Lucky Guy. His struggles with substance abuse and bipolar disorder were discussed in a 2014 episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now?</p><h2 id=becky-ann-baker-under-review><strong>Becky Ann Baker – Under Review</strong></h2><p>Best known for her role as Jean Weir on Freaks and Geeks, Baker was introduced to a new generation with her role as Lareen, Hannah’s mother, on Girls.

She has also done guest spots on many top TV shows over the years as well, including L.A. Law, Frasier, Star Trek: Voyager, and Sex & the City. She, like many others from the cast, is also an accomplished stage performer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Star Wars: Every Member Of The Light Side’s Net Worth</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWifmae5tHnCmqqtZZ6awbi70a2fZqqRo7imsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgirls-cast-networth-ranked.html&text=Every%20Cast%20Member%20of%20Girls%27%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgirls-cast-networth-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgirls-cast-networth-ranked.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20of%20Girls%27%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgirls-cast-networth-ranked.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20of%20Girls%27%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgirls-cast-networth-ranked.html&title=Every%20Cast%20Member%20of%20Girls%27%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgirls-cast-networth-ranked.html&description=Every%20Cast%20Member%20of%20Girls%27%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./guy-fieri-has-a-tattoo-as-a-tribute-to-his-late-sister-what-exactly-happened-to-morgan-315337-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guy Fieri Has A Tattoo As A Tribute To His Late Sister  What Exactly Happened To Morgan?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dance-gavin-dance-blue-dream-lyrics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dance Gavin Dance  Blue Dream Lyrics">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
