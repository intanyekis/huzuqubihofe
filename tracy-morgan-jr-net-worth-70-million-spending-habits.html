After all, there is something about Morgan that is inherently lovable yet he has also been willing to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">court controversy</a> at every turn throughout his career. In addition to being a fascinating human being, Morgan has enjoyed a lot of success during his life which has a lot to do with the fact that he is said to have a net worth of $70 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering the fact that most celebrities have made a lot of money during their lives, it has become very interesting to compare how various stars spend their cash. For example, George Lucas has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">donated half of his fortune</a> to charity but he also owns a private jet and uses his money to bankroll the production of more experimental films.</p><p>Given how fascinating Tracy Morgan is as a human being, it is easy to imagine him spending his money on some entertaining and surprising things. Instead of simply imagining what Morgan has done with his fortune, it makes a lot more sense to do some research and detail how the man spends the cash he has earned.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rumor Mill Thought Bill Gates Bought a $644 Million Superyacht... Here Are Some Celebrities That Actually 'Took The Plunge' On Cool Boat Purchases</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tracy-s-mega-mansion>Tracy’s Mega Mansion</h2><p>Back in 2015, Tracy Morgan forked over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$13.9 million for a home</a> that is so impressive that it seems like it is a dream come true. Built in Alpine, New Jersey, the three-floor mansion included 22 different rooms including seven bedrooms, ten full bathrooms, and 2 half baths. Anytime a home has more bathrooms than bedrooms, you know it was built for the truly wealthy.</p><p>Of all the things in the world, it turns out that Tracy Morgan has a passion for collecting undersea animals. For that reason, Morgan has a series of massive water tanks both inside and outside his mansion. In fact, Morgan reportedly spent $400,000 to have only one of his many tanks installed. Thanks to owning all of those tanks, in the past Morgan has been able to buy an eel, seven sharks, two stingrays, and an abundance of other fish.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Tracy Morgan isn’t busy looking at his many tanks, there were a lot of other things he could do in the New Jersey mansion he bought in 2015. For example, there is a “double-height” basketball court with a custom mural of Morgan’s favorite Knicks players on the wall. If Morgan got bored of shooting hoops, he could always walk over to the bowling alley, check out the movie theater, or enjoy the billiards room.</p><p>In terms of the design of the mansion Tracy Morgan bought in 2015, it had oversized windows and chandeliers, a double-wide staircase, and a spacious kitchen with an adjoining breakfast room. Outside the mansion, a large pool that sits beside a cabana with a kitchen and bathroom can be found. In short, Morgan’s mansion practically screams wealth, unlike some stars who prefer to outwardly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">live like they aren’t rich</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake's Mansion Isn't Just Nice...

Instead, Morgan likes to travel in some incredibly expensive and downright gorgeous cars. On the bright side, Morgan still is a man of the people as one time he was driving in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a $440,000 Lamborghini</a> Aventador Roadster when he pulled over and sat on a bus stop bench to talk with fans.</p><p>In 2019, Tracy Morgan spent a huge chunk of change on a $2 million Bugatti supercar. Unfortunately for Morgan, things quickly turned sour for him as almost immediately after he got his hands on the Bugatti he got into a fender bender. Of course, Morgan quickly got the Bugatti fixed up but it is pretty funny that the other car in the fender bender was a cheap Honda CR-V.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Floyd Mayweather's Car Collection Better Than Conor McGregor's? You Be The Judge</a></span></p><h2 id=miscellaneous-purchases>Miscellaneous Purchases</h2><p>When a lot of people think of the major purchases they’ve made in their lives, it is their house and cars that come to mind first. When you are as rich as Tracy Morgan is, however, you can afford to plunk down a huge amount of money on a slew of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other things</a>. For example, according to reports, Morgan has spent a fortune on his mind-boggling sneaker collection that is said to include more than 10,000 pairs.</p><p>A big fan of items that are linked to his favorite celebrities, according to Tracy Morgan he has tried but failed to buy things like Evil Knievel’s helmet and Bruce Lee's nunchucks in the past. On the bright side, the hilarious actor has said that he succeeded in his attempt to buy one of the legendary gloves Michael Jackson wore during a performance in Newark, Germany. Additionally, Morgan has a long history of buying expensive jewelry and arcade games as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Penn Jillette Spends His $200 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mTrnquu9GgmKdlmqd6r7HTZq6oqqSdenh8jKagpaSZpLtuv8%2BepZ2hnpx6qa3BoqusZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftracy-morgan-jr-net-worth-70-million-spending-habits.html&text=Here%27s%20How%20Tracy%20Morgan%20Is%20Spending%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftracy-morgan-jr-net-worth-70-million-spending-habits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftracy-morgan-jr-net-worth-70-million-spending-habits.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Tracy%20Morgan%20Is%20Spending%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftracy-morgan-jr-net-worth-70-million-spending-habits.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Tracy%20Morgan%20Is%20Spending%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftracy-morgan-jr-net-worth-70-million-spending-habits.html&title=Here%27s%20How%20Tracy%20Morgan%20Is%20Spending%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftracy-morgan-jr-net-worth-70-million-spending-habits.html&description=Here%27s%20How%20Tracy%20Morgan%20Is%20Spending%20His%20%2470%20Million%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jack-parkinson-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="News!
