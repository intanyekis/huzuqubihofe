Whether its spiced rum or a bottle of Peach Schnapps, there are all sorts of bottles on the market that are suitable for all sorts of occasions and for any mood you might be in.</p><p>However, after years of mundane drinks, some manufactures thought it would be wise to create an exclusive and extravagant beverage for the upper-class citizens. These bottles are so elaborate that only a small number of people will ever get a chance to take a sip of these special drinks. And I'm not talking bottles of alcohol that cost in the thousands, but rather in the millions!</p><p>What makes the drinks on this list so expensive are the highly detailed bottles that holds the special liquid inside. The hand-crafted bottles took some designers several months to even years to complete and many had world-renowned jewelers working by their side to complete the project. That is a lot of commitment for a bottle of liquor that won't be remembered for anything but the contents within for the most affluent of drinkers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These bottles are more than just drinks; they are a form of art that only some of the richest people can afford to adorn their liquor cabinets with. From bottles as "cheap" as $8,400 to to over $6 million, these are&nbsp;10 Ridiculously Over-Priced Alcohol Bottles You'll Never Be Able To Buy.</p><h2 id=10-ladoga-imperial-vodka---8-400-per-bottle><strong>10.&nbsp;Ladoga Imperial Vodka - $8,400 Per Bottle</strong></h2><p>Via imgkid.com</p><p>In 2012, Ladoga Imperial crafted a special collection of high-end Russian vodka. The idea was to package the vodka in a Fabergé-like egg and sell them at $4,000 to $8,400 apiece. Each egg is specially crafted using crystals and 24-karat gold which is used to house a decanter that holds the premium vodka.</p><p>The vodka is made using the freshest water from Lake Ladoga and uses homegrown wheat and rye. The manufacturer expects to sell about 100 bottles a year, making it all the more exclusive.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-diva-vodka---1-2-million-per-bottle><strong>9.

Specially crafted in Scotland, Diva Vodka is considered one of the world’s most expensive vodkas and is one of the purest vodkas in the market. The three-times distilled drink is first filtered through ice, then a special Nordic birch charcoal and finally precious gems that have been crushed into sand to ensure the vodka has been completely purified.</p><p>The drink alone would cost a person $4,000; however it’s the bottle that puts the cost of Diva Vodka over a million. Every bottle comes with 48 Swarovski crystals, each hand-picked and packed into a rod. Every bottle comes with an assortment of six different types of gems which include: cubic zirconia, pink tourmaline, smoky topaz, amethyst, citrine and peridotite. Each gem is then hand-filled into the rod and placed into the center, making every bottle unique and colorful in its own way. Diva Vodka is one of the finest vodkas around and is suitable for the most lavish of celebrations.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-russo-baltique---1-3-million><strong>8.&nbsp;Russo-Baltique - $1.3 Million</strong></h2><p>Via pinterest.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Russo-Baltique is known as the world’s most expensive vodka and was created with the intentions of impressing Russian royalty. Costing a mere $1.3 million, the vodka was made in celebration of Russo-Balt’s, one of Russia’s first companies to manufacture cars, 100 year anniversary. The project was funded by Princess Regina Abdurazakova of Kazakhstan, who claims she was looking to invest her father’s money. This bottle was made with 30 centimeter thick bulletproof glass to ensure that none of the precious drink is wasted.</p><p>The liquid is stored in a replica flask of the company’s radiator that is minted with gold coins from 1908 to 1912. The cap itself is made from white and yellow gold and is covered in diamonds. Although this bottle is exclusive to only some of the richest people on earth, the bottle made a TV debut in season 3 of Netflix' original series House of Cards.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-henri-iv-dudognon-heritage-cognac---1-9-million><strong>7.&nbsp;Henri IV Dudognon Heritage Cognac - $1.9 Million</strong></h2><p>Via stylecrave.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Henri IV Dudognon Heritage Cognac is a bottle truly fit for a king.

It was designed by the same person that sells the most expensive bottle of tequila, Fernando Altamarino, and created by renowned jeweler Jose Davalos. The creation weighs a total 8 kilograms and much like Diva Vodka, it’s the bottle that makes this concoction truly special.</p><p>A solid platinum bottle dipped in 24 karats of white gold and covered in 6,500 carefully cut diamonds. Some people have dubbed this as “the DNA of cognac….[and] the essence of the water of life.” This bottle is known as one of the most luxurious elixir around, hand crafted by descendants of French King Henri IV in 1776. This cognac is like no other and simply getting to hold the bottle is a sign of privilege.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-chambord-royale-deluxe---2-million><strong>6.

Altamarino was aiming for the world record for most expensive tequila bottle when he crafted the Pasion Azteca Platinum Tequila. Using the same design as Henri IVCognac, he decided to go for the sleek design but only this time it would be much more elaborate. The concept for the bottle took the creator&nbsp;10&nbsp;months to establish before needing&nbsp;another four years just to complete the project. The bottle weighs five pounds and is embedded with 328 karats worth of diamonds, a total of 4,000 diamonds that the designer carefully added by hand. It costs $3.5 million per bottle.</p><p>What makes the liquor so special is that it is made with three different types of aged tequila. It is part 3-year-old tequila, part six-year-old tequila and finally mixed with nine-year-old agave tequila.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-billionaire-vodka---3-7-million><strong>3.

The purchase of the bottle also comes with a personal 24-hour concierge and a pair of white gloves, with the words&nbsp;Billionaire Vodka written in gold letters The exclusivity of tasting this vodka makes their slogan, “It’s good to be king," all the more real.
