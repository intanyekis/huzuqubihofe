Every other day or week, there’s a new show coming in.</p><p>Another Netflix show hit the streaming platform on 16th October 2020. And, it is none other than the Dream Home Makeover, which is a six-episode series starring the husband-wife duo Shea McGee and <a href=#>Syd McGee</a>.</p><p>In the writing below is everything you need to know about Shea McGee and her married life with Syd. Perfect timing to peek-a-boo the couple’s life off the screen, before you see them taking on home projects!</p><p><strong>See More:&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label="Edit “Shana Render Wiki: Age, Net Worth, Killer Mike, Height”">Shana Render Wiki: Age, Net Worth, Killer Mike, Height</a></strong></p><h3>Biography — Age, Birthday, Zodiac</h3><p>In the summer of 2020, Shea McGee turned 35 years of age. Moving on, the 5th of July marked her birthday.</p><p>To mention her zodiac sign, Shea is a Gemini.</p><h3><strong>Shea McGee Wiki — Mormon, Family, Education</strong></h3><p>Regarding Shea McGee and her husband’s being Mormons, there are no definitive answers to it.</p><p>Speculations surrounding their faith must have originated from the fact that Shea graduated from Brigham Young University. The private researcher university happens to be owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or the Mormon Church.</p><p>There she got a B.A. in Communications and Public Relations in 2007 before going for Interior Design at Saddleback College.</p><p>Shea comes from a family in Texas and her maiden name is Miller. Regarding family background, she would be telling more probably on Netflix’s episodes.</p><h3><strong>Shea McGee Height, Weight, Measurements</strong></h3><p>Gorgeous Shea McGee stands to a height of 5 feet and 3 inches. Most lately, her weight was listed under 49 Kg and she had 33-24-32 inches measurements.</p><p><strong>Also, Don’t Miss:&nbsp;<a href=# aria-label="Edit “Georgi Rusev Wiki, Darcey Silva, Job, Height, Family, Age”">Georgi Rusev Wiki, Darcey Silva, Job, Height, Family, Age</a></strong></p><h3><strong>Social Media Reach: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter</strong></h3><p>Shea McGee is on social media representing her work as an interior designer.</p><p>On Instagram, the handle is McGee & Co., which is the McGee family’s online merch store featuring designer furnishings and homewares. Also, she managed another profile, Studio McGee.&nbsp;Respectively, the two accounts entertained 1 million and 2.3 million followers.</p><p>Those interested in the home decor and designs can also look them up on Facebook and Twitter.</p><h3><strong>Shea McGee Net Worth, Design, Dream Home Makeover</strong></h3><p>The episodes of Dream Home Makeover would show Shea and her husband take over all kinds of projects from budget-friendly makeovers to full-blown extravagant home makeovers.</p><p>The duo work under their own interior design and e-commerce business company with the name Studio McGee.</p><p>In the trailer of the show, they said about helping clients with budgets from $20k to anywhere up to $2 million. Also, according to Netflix, the company hired 70 employees and dealt with clients all over the world.</p><p>This happened circa 2014 after Shea with a two-month-old baby thought on blossoming her “little” design business as she launched a website and got an Instagram account. “My business grew exponentially,” Shea recalled.</p><p>People from throughout Southern California, and even across the country, asked her to design their home. At the time, she had no idea how to handle the workload. But working with her husband was never on her mind. Until on a certain day, it clicked to her when Syd was searching for a new start-up to dive into. “I remember crying and asking, ‘Are you sure we can do this?”, she said. And the answer, as we can see it now, was surely a ‘Yes”.</p><p>The couple then sold their home, moved to Utah, and started Studio McGee in Salt Lake City.</p><p>Years later, as Syd and Shea McGee collectively boast a net worth of around $4-5 million, they have a dreamy new home in Utah. The place is no doubt every interior design lover’s dream. Much of the home is featured on its Instagram account.</p><p>Together, Syd and Shea have teamed up with Threshold for Target to launch their own home decor line, which is available everywhere, in case you are interested.</p><h3><strong>Shea & Syd McGee: Dating, Wedding, Kids</strong></h3><p>Shea McGee met Syd through her brother. The McGee siblings were moving home and Shea went along to help him, when Syd, who was a friend of her brother’s had come along.</p><p>In the couple’s book, Make Life Beautiful, Shea describes the moment as– “There Syd was on a skateboard, wearing the skinniest skinny jeans I had ever seen. We went on our first date the next night.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-22011 alt=Shea-McGee-Wiki-Net-Worth-Age-Syd-Height-Weight-2020 width=300 height=391 data-sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsoffline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shea-McGee-Wiki-Net-Worth-Age-Syd-Height-Weight-2020-2-230x300.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-22011 class=wp-caption-text><strong>‘Make Life Beautiful’, releasing on 27th October in 2020!</strong> (PIC: Studio McGee’s IG)</p><p>The two got married in 2008 when they both were 23 years of age.
