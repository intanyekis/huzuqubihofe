For that reason, there is a very long history of people seeking out the graves of departed celebrities and visiting their final resting places.</p><p>Every year, thousands of Elvis Presley's fans flock to his grave which is in Graceland although <a href=#>the singer initially was buried elsewhere</a>. Similarly, some fans want to find <a href=#>the final resting place of Mac Miller</a> who passed away far too early.</p><p>Unfortunately, Elvis and Mac Miller aren't buried in the same place so fans will have to travel a lot to go to both of their graves. On top of that, they'd have to go to another location to see <a href=#>where Hugh Hefner and Marilyn Monroe were put to rest</a> beside each other. On the other hand, anyone who visits Forest Lawn Memorial Park can see the final resting place of many stars in the same place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-golden-age-celebrities-are-buried-at-forest-lawn-memorial-park>Which Golden Age Celebrities Are Buried At Forest Lawn Memorial Park?</h2><p>Over the last several years, it has become common for movies and TV shows to be produced in places like San Francisco, Chicago, Vancouver, New York City, and Toronto.
