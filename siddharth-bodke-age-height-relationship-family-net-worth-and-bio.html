He was born in Nasik on November 30, 1995. He went to Day Care School in Nasik for his early education and then NBT Law College for his college education. During high school and college, he was involved in cultural activities and led the way in planning a number of festivals and cultural programs. This gave him a knack for acting, which became his passion later on.</p><p>So, once he was done with school, he went to Mumbai to follow his dreams. After some trouble, he was able to get a part in a TV show called Tu Ashi Javli Raha, which is about to start on the Zee Yuva channel. But he got lucky and got the M Town movie first instead of the TV show. His first venture into entertainment in a local language was a movie called “Bhay,” which came out in the summer of 2018.</p><figure id=attachment_21435 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-21435 class="wp-caption aligncenter">Siddharth Bodke</figure><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Nash and Chord Overstreet Are Famous Brother Each Doing His Own Thing</strong></p><p>Even though he is the most eligible bachelor in town, he is still very single and not ready to start dating. He is focusing on his career right now, which the actor says has just begun. He likes to use social media and can often be found on Facebook and other sites like it. He has been advertising his TV show on top of all the other ways he does it. Stay with us to find out more about it and other things.</p><p>Siddharth Bodke has been getting a lot of praise for his role as David in “Drishyam 2,” which also stars Ajay Devgn and Tabu. But David wasn’t the part he was chosen for at first.</p><p>Abhishek Pathak, the director of the movie, insisted that he try out for the part of David. As fate would have it, he did a great job at the audition and got the part.</p><p>About the same thing, he told IANS: “I got a call from the casting agency for Vicky Sidana and tried out for another part in the movie. I was even chosen for that. Later, the director, Abhishek Pathak, asked me to try out for the part of David. That’s how I got the part. I have to say that I loved playing it because it was hard.”</p><p>The actor, who is currently on the popular TV show “Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Mein,” talked about how he prepared for his role in the movie.</p><p>He talked about his role in the movie and said: “It’s a Goan who is a Catholic. I talked to some people from Goa to learn their language. Later, I asked the director to make the character’s voice a little different, so I gave it a bit of a husky sound. This was necessary because my character used to sell drugs. I have also tried to get to know David better. When I first met the director, he told me to put on some weight, so I did. I gained about 4-5 kg for the role, and my thick beard helped me look the part.”</p><p>He said this about what the director told him: “Before the shoot, Abhishek told me everything, and we met in his office before going to Goa. He went over the whole graph, and when we were on set, we would talk about it first to keep the mood and intensity high.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/smartindianews.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Siddharth-Bodke-1-300x231.png><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;Is Jojo Siwa, Famous American Dancer Pregnant?

Talking to Bollywood Life, Siddharth Bodke said, “So, a year after the pandemic, I got a call from the casting agency for Vicky Sidana. I went there and tried out for a few parts.

From the time the promo broke, there was a tremendous response. I was happy, grateful, and eager to do a better job.”</p><p>“The fans’ reactions have given me all the drive I need. Jagtap has always wanted Sai, and it was interesting to see how the same crazy things brought him back into Sai’s life. Siddharth says, “Jagtap has always been a surprise.”</p><p>“We were waiting for this moment to come,” he said about his off-screen friendship with Ayesha Singh. Ayesha and I are very good friends. It was a lot of fun to see the same cast and crew again. It was also great working with Neil.”</p><p>Siddharth talks about how busy he is at work by saying, “I have been busy with a few web projects and theater. I also have a movie in the works. It was a great feeling when I was asked to come back to Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin.</p><p>“I believe that any role I play should be fun for my fans. “I never want my fans to be unhappy with any of the roles I play!” he says.</p><p>Ghum Hai Kisikey Pyaar Meiin is doing well.

All of the attention has been drawn to the show’s latest plot.</p><p>The show has moved on, and Sai and Virat are no longer together. Virat is married to Patralekha, also known as Pakhi, and they have a son together named Vinayak. Sai lives with her daughter Savi.</p><p>Vinayak can’t walk because his legs have been hurt since he was born. When Sai and Vinayak meet, they get along well. Vinayak only wants to get help from Sai, so he brings Virat with him to get help.</p><p>When Virat finds out that Sai is still alive and has a daughter, he is shocked. For those who don’t know, Virat doesn’t know Savi is his daughter. He sees Jagtap with Sai and thinks Savi is the daughter of Jagtap and Sai.</p><p>The part of Jagtap is played by Siddharth Bodke. He used to play a bad role, but now he plays a good one. Now, he’s Sai’s friend and helps her. Fans have also started to love how well Jagtap and Sai get along. Well, Ayesha and Siddharth are also good friends away from the camera.</p><p>In an interview with India Forums, Siddharth talked about how they felt about each other “We both began the show at the same time with Ayesha. We were both on screen when the show first started, and the thought of that is always there. It makes us feel comfortable and close to each other.”</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;Aishwarya Sharma Age, Height, Relationship, Family, Net Worth and Bio</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGiqopyUna6zwMdmmaicm5p6orPEZp%2BeoZedwW6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mnZqlmaHGbrrErWSwp6KptW6tzZ1km6GfZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio.html&text=Siddharth%20Bodke%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Family%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Bio%20The%20Talks%20Today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio.html&title=Siddharth%20Bodke%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Family%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Bio%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio.html&title=Siddharth%20Bodke%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Family%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Bio%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio.html&title=Siddharth%20Bodke%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Family%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Bio%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsiddharth-bodke-age-height-relationship-family-net-worth-and-bio.html&description=Siddharth%20Bodke%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Relationship%2c%20Family%2c%20Net%20Worth%20and%20Bio%20The%20Talks%20Today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swifts-jake-gyllenhaal-lyrics-on-10-minute-all-too-well.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift's Jake Gyllenhaal Lyrics on 10-Minute 'All Too Well'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jane-seymour-poses-for-playboy-at-67-pic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jane Seymour Poses for Playboy at 67: Pic!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
