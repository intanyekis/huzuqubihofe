Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn don't speak much about their relationship, but when they do, the world listens. <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift </a></strong>has been infamously tagged as a “serial dater” for at least half of her career. But ever since the Kimye scandal back in 2016, the "Blank Space" songwriter decided to live a quiet life, attempting to stay out of the limelight at all costs, and for a good reason. This includes her relationship with her long-time beau, Joe Alwyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple allegedly <a href=#>first crossed paths</a> back in May 2016 at the Vogue's Met Gala, but it wasn’t until January 2017 that Taylor finally confirmed that she and the Harriet actor were dating. According to Glamour, The "Look What You Made Me Do" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singer set the record straight </a>that she “wants it to stay that way because I don’t want anything about this to change or become too complicated or intruded upon.”</p><p>It seems like everything is in accordance with her plan since their first paparazzi shots were taken five months after she confirmed their relationship. Taylor has hardly talked about their relationship in public since, but when she does, the world can’t stop gushing about it.</p><h2 id=how-taylor-swift-and-joe-alywn-maintain-their-relationship><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Taylor Swift And Joe Alywn Maintain Their Relationship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The "Cardigan" singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first talked about her relationship with Joe Alwyn </a>when she sat down with The Guardian talking about her feuds, fame, and political stand. When asked about why she and Alwyn are rarely photographed together, she said, “I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and our relationship isn’t up for discussion.”</p><p>She then added, “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it – but it’s just that it goes out into the world. That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Are Keeping Their Relationship Quiet</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-39-s-sweet-words-for-joe-alwyn-in-miss-americana><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Taylor Swift's Sweet Words For Joe Alwyn In Miss Americana</span></h2><p>In the midst of the pandemic in 2020, Taylor Swift released her biopic, Miss Americana, where she talked about where she went after her infamous feud with <strong><a href=#>Kanye West</a></strong>. At that time, Taylor felt a little lonely, saying, “I didn’t have a partner that I climbed [that mountain] with that I could high-five. I didn’t have anyone I could talk to that could relate to it. I had my mom, but I just wondered…Shouldn’t there be someone I could call right now?”</p><p>After dating Joe Alwyn, she then said that they have “decided together” to keep their relationship private. “Even though it was [a] really horrible [time], I was happy. But I wasn’t happy in the way I was trained to be happy. It was happiness without anyone else’s input. We were just…happy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-shared-she-co-wrote-folklore-with-joe-alwyn><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Swift Shared She Co-Wrote Folklore With Joe Alwyn</span></h2><p>When Taylor Swift first released her Grammy-Award winning album Folkore, fans wondered who is the mystery co-writer was for her songs ‘betty’ and ‘exile.’ Who was masked behind the pseudonym “William Bowery”. Swift finally exposes the<a href=#> identity of William Bowery </a>in her new Disney+ film folklore: the long pond studio sessions.</p><p>“There’s been a lot of discussion about William Bowery and his identity because it’s not a real person,” she said. “So, William Bowery is Joe, as we know. He plays piano beautifully, and he’s always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things. ... It was a step that we would have never have taken, because why would we have ever written a song together?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Taylor Swift And Her Boyfriend Write Songs Together</a></span></p><h2 id=joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift-39-s-bond-over-music><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift's Bond Over Music</span></h2><p>After Folklore's sister album, Evermore, was released in December 2020, Taylor Swift said in an Apple Music interview. “Joe and I really love sad songs. We've always bonded over music.”</p><p>She then added, “I say it was a surprise that we started writing together, but in a way, it wasn't because we have always bonded over music and had the same musical tastes. And he's always the person who's showing me songs by artists and then they become my favorite songs or whatever. But yeah, ‘Champagne Problems,’ that was one of my favorite bridges to write.

She eventually felt she couldn't keep quiet any longer and received a confidence boost from her lover when she decided to use her platform.</p><p>"I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend, who supported me in speaking out," the "Bad Blood" singer recalled. "I started talking to my family and friends about politics and learning as much as I could about where I stand.
