The actor has been involved with projects of all sizes, and he has put together a wildly underrated Hollywood career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Galecki had some early career wins with 1989's Christmas Vacation and the iconic 1990s sitcom Roseanne helping him become a recognizable face in entertainment.</p><p>Johnny also scored roles in projects like I Know What You Did Last Summer, Vanilla Sky, and My Name is Earl, among many others.</p><p>Galecki had done well for himself earlier in his career, but things really hit another level when he was cast as one of the lead characters on CBS' The Big Bang Theory.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Johnny Galecki Was Upset With The Way Jim Parsons Handled His Big Bang Theory Exit, But Parsons Has An Explanation For Why He Didn't Warn The Cast</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-galecki-changed-his-career-on-the-big-bang-theory>Johnny Galecki Changed His Career On The Big Bang Theory</h2><p>Debuting back in September 2007, The Big Bang Theory became another smash hit from Chuck Lorre, the man behind countless hit sitcoms.</p><p>Galecki was cast as Leonard Hofstadter on the show, and he was a brilliant pick for the character. Galecki brought plenty of the nerdy charm he used as David on Roseanne, and this translated well to The Big Bang Theory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the show dominated on the small screen, Galecki and the rest of the cast began cashing in on some of the biggest paydays in TV history.</p><p>"Galecki's earnings steadily increased through the years with Big Bang Theory. During the first season, the actor earned $60,000 per episode, although those numbers would increase with time. By season two, he was earning $250,000 per episode – a trend that would continue till season four. The actors' wages increased once again from seasons 5 to 7, reaching $350,000 per episode. This exponential growth continued until the series ended in 2019. It is reported that Galecki earned $900,000 per episode of Big Bang Theory between 2007 and 2019. In addition, the cast managed to negotiate a deal that entitled them to 1 percent of the show's backend equity," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth reported</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, the show officially came to an end, marking the end of an era for CBS. Since then, people have not seen much of Galecki.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Johnny Galecki And Melissa Rauch Got Close Behind The Scenes On The Big Bang Theory In A Very Unexpected Way</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-johnny-galecki-doing-now>What Is Johnny Galecki Doing Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49736444.jpg><p>So, what in the world has Johnny Galecki been up to since The Big Bang Theory came to an end on TV? In what may come as a surprise to some, Galecki has been lying low, sticking to enjoying fatherhood and a quiet life.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> shows that he spent some time on The Conners, reprising the role of David on the show. Galecki also voiced Henry in A Dog's Journey. Outside of that, he has not done any other acting, and he has nothing on deck at the moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To be fair, after spending so much time on TV with his multiple hit shows, it's got to be nice for the actor to simply relax and enjoy life for a while. However, in the past, Galecki has said he tends to get bored between projects, according to IMDb.</p><p>I don't know what to do with myself between films. I end up doing unhealthy things like shopping or drinking. I'm pretty schizophrenic about it.</p><p>Of course, <a href=# rel=nofollow>an estimated net worth of $100 million</a> certainly makes things a lot easier, as Galecki can do whatever he wants while he's off work. In the meantime, it's likely that he's taking time off behind the scenes to bond with his young son.</p><p>Avery was born in 2019, and while Johnny and his ex aren't together anymore, they seem to be on good terms for their son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Johnny Galecki Admitted His Performance Would Have Declined Had He Continued The Big Bang Theory Without Jim Parsons</a></span></p><p>Galecki may not have any projects on deck at the moment, but this does not mean that he is done with acting forever. Should the actor make a return to TV, it's possible that he'll make his way onto yet another hit sitcom, which could make him one of TV's most successful actors of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brbOoaWnsV2crq2xwqSgZpmWqbKzedOhnGaamZx6o63NoGStoJWkv7p7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-galecki-after-the-big-bang-theory.html&text=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Galecki%20After%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-galecki-after-the-big-bang-theory.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-galecki-after-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Galecki%20After%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-galecki-after-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Galecki%20After%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-galecki-after-the-big-bang-theory.html&title=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Galecki%20After%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-johnny-galecki-after-the-big-bang-theory.html&description=What%20Happened%20To%20Johnny%20Galecki%20After%20The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./athletes-who-cheated-and-got-caught.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 Disgraced Athletes Who Cheated...And Got Caught">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sky-katz-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sky Katz  Bio (Wiki) ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
