The community mourns the loss of a cherished individual, and since the announcement of his death, tributes and condolences have flooded in, testifying to the impact he had on countless lives.</p><p>As of this publication, the circumstances surrounding Leon Pilewski’s passing, including the precise cause of death, remain undisclosed, leaving the public in anticipation of further details. Updates will be shared as soon as more information becomes available, allowing those who mourn his loss to gain a better understanding of the events surrounding his untimely departure.</p><p>Leon Pilewski’s legacy is one of respect, influence, and dedication to education. For many, he was more than an educator; he was a mentor, a leader, and a friend. The outpouring of heartfelt condolences and tributes from the community is a testament to the profound impact he had on individuals across different stages of life.</p><p>Barry Calef shared a <a href=# rel=noopener>post on fb</a>:</p>Rest In Peace Mr. Leon Pilewski… He was my high school assistant principal and I made him work pretty hard back then. We got to know each other very well later in life and he served as principal for my daughter, 2007-2010. I meant to speak with Mr. Pilewski over the past couple of years about possibly building a storm shelter at RCB that could also be used for picnics on campus. My thought was to name the shelter, Pilewski Pavillion, but now I can’t ask him because I waited too long. Coincidentally, a pavillion is in the works now. If you get time, take a minute to listen to his last commencement address in 2011, I will put the video I took in the comments below. “Make it a great day, or not, the choice is yours.” – Leon Pilewski<p>One such tribute comes from Barry Clef, who shared a poignant reflection on his relationship with Mr. Pilewski: “He was my high school assistant principal, and I made him work pretty hard back then. We got to know each other very well later in life, and he served as principal for my daughter from 2007 to 2010.” Clef also expressed a missed opportunity, stating, “I meant to speak with Mr. Pilewski over the past couple of years about possibly building a storm shelter at RCB that could also be used for picnics on campus. My thought was to name the shelter Pilewski Pavilion, but now I can’t ask him because I waited too long. Coincidentally, a pavilion is in the works now.”</p><p>As the community navigates through this somber time, everyone is encouraged to keep the Pilewski family in their thoughts and prayers. The loss of Leon Pilewski is felt deeply, but his impact on education and the lives he touched will live on in the memories of those who were fortunate enough to know him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kv7h5x6KeoWWjmLWwu8tmmKyrmajBorrTZqeroZ6YtrGty2ajnqeeYr2quMSwqqShXaWutL%2FErGSar5Gueqq6jJyjmqqbqK%2B2vsZmppuhpKqus8WO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frw-high-school-assistant-principal-leon-pilewski-passes-away-in-clarksburg-obituary.html&text=RW%20High%20School%20Assistant%20Principal%20Leon%20Pilewski%20passes%20away%20in%20Clarksburg%3a%20Obituary&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frw-high-school-assistant-principal-leon-pilewski-passes-away-in-clarksburg-obituary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frw-high-school-assistant-principal-leon-pilewski-passes-away-in-clarksburg-obituary.html&title=RW%20High%20School%20Assistant%20Principal%20Leon%20Pilewski%20passes%20away%20in%20Clarksburg%3a%20Obituary" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frw-high-school-assistant-principal-leon-pilewski-passes-away-in-clarksburg-obituary.html&title=RW%20High%20School%20Assistant%20Principal%20Leon%20Pilewski%20passes%20away%20in%20Clarksburg%3a%20Obituary" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frw-high-school-assistant-principal-leon-pilewski-passes-away-in-clarksburg-obituary.html&title=RW%20High%20School%20Assistant%20Principal%20Leon%20Pilewski%20passes%20away%20in%20Clarksburg%3a%20Obituary" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frw-high-school-assistant-principal-leon-pilewski-passes-away-in-clarksburg-obituary.html&description=RW%20High%20School%20Assistant%20Principal%20Leon%20Pilewski%20passes%20away%20in%20Clarksburg%3a%20Obituary" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-masked-singers-most-shocking-reveal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is The Masked Singer's most shocking reveal?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./megan-mullally-reveals-will-grace-guest-stars-nervous-behavior-w456456.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Mullally Reveals Will &amp;amp; Grace' Guest Stars Nervous Behavior">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
