It had an industrial rock vibe going on, tackling heavy themes like self-harm, depression, and addiction.</p><p>But then the Man in Black himself, <a href=#>Johnny Cash</a>, stepped up to the plate with his remake for his album American IV: The Man Comes Around. And quite famously, Cash's version took a whole different direction!</p><p>Stripped down to its bare bones, Cash turned it into an acoustic country jam that poured out all his personal battles with health and mortality – and the emotional result ended up being one of his final recordings before he passed away in 2003.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cash's cover earned him some serious street cred too, as the remake received praise from critics and fans across genres. It even landed Cash a Grammy nomination and secured him a spot in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>!</p><p>The power of music is truly universal. Going from gritty industrial rock to soulful country charm – Johnny Cash definitely left an everlasting mark on this song, as only Man in Black could.</p><h2 id=killing-me-softly-with-his-song-by-the-fugees-1996><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Killing Me Softly With His Song, By The Fugees (1996)</span></h2><p>Let's take a trip down memory lane to a folk pop gem that dropped for the first time back in 1971. This song, originally penned by Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel, was brought to life by the talented Lori Lieberman.</p><p>She drew inspiration from one of her own experiences – a soul-stirring encounter with Don McLean, during one of his live performances. The Fugees (an American hip hop group comprising Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, and Pras Michel) recorded their rendition for their second album aptly titled The Score.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In doing so, their remake transformed the original folk pop vibe into an awesome blend of hip hop and soul. Imagine rap verses melting together seamlessly with Lauryn Hill's powerful vocals.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/adam-lambert-queen.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Meet Adam Lambert: The New Frontman Of Queen</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>From Idol to Icon: Discover Adam Lambert's rise to fame, his reign as Queen's frontman, and how he turned hits into millions.</span><p>Not only that — it also skyrocketed into the realm of best-selling singles ever, and over 15 million copies sold worldwide like hotcakes.</p><h2 id=torn-by-natalie-imbruglia-1997><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Torn, By Natalie Imbruglia (1997)</span></h2><p>Back in 1995, when the world was still grooving to alternative rock tunes, a little gem called Torn made its debut. Originally penned by Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, and Phil Thornalley from Ednaswap, this soulful track spoke volumes about the anguish of a shattered romance.</p><p>Fast forward to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natalie Imbruglia's game changing remake</a> for her first album Left of the Middle - an explosion of pop rock goodness. Imbruglia, hailing all the way from Australia (and known not only as a singer-songwriter, but also as an actress with serious credits under her belt) took this already emotive song and turned it into an international sensation that set her music career on fire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It wasn't just any ordinary hit; it shot to the top of the charts everywhere and became one of the hottest singles of the 1990s. Believe it or not, over ten million copies flew off shelves worldwide.</p><p>Imbruglia's remake had such a massive impact that it became a defining moment in her career – a true turning point.</p><h2 id=girls-just-want-to-have-fun-by-cyndi-lauper-1983><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Girls Just Want to Have Fun, By Cyndi Lauper (1983)</span></h2><p>Now we're going to talk about a legendary song that shook the music scene and became an anthem for women everywhere. Brace yourselves as we dive into the world of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyndi Lauper's</a> iconic remake of Girls Just Want To Have Fun.</p><p>It all started way back in 1979, when Robert Hazard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crafted this new wave gem</a>. Back then, music was more commonly about showcasing women as mere objects who craved men's attention.</p><p>In 1983, Lauper took this tune and transformed it into something extraordinary for her debut album. This revamped version packed a mighty punch — a fierce blend of pop rock that unleashed sheer feminist power like never before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Girls Just Want To Have Fun skyrocketed up the charts worldwide, becoming one of those anthems that defined an entire generation. It wasn't just another catchy tune; it represented women claiming their independence and celebrating unabashed joy.</p><p>This infectious track earned Lauper not one but two Grammy nominations — talk about making waves. Cyndi even snagged a well-deserved spot in the prestigious Grammy Hall of Fame because she completely owned this masterpiece.</p><h2 id=i-love-rock-39-n-39-roll-by-joan-jett-amp-the-blackhearts-1981><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>I Love Rock 'n' Roll, By Joan Jett & The Blackhearts (1981)</span></h2><p>Once upon a groovy 1975, a group known as The Arrows unleashed this glam rock masterpiece upon the world. This sonic gem was all about worshiping at the altar of rock music - pure magic wrapped in leather jackets.</p><p>With every strum and soulful note, they paid homage to their undying love for this electrifying genre. Let's jump a few years to the roaring 1980s, when Joan Jett & The Blackhearts stormed onto the scene like lightning bolts from heaven.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Led by none other than Joan Jett herself (who previously rocked out with The Runaways), these rebels had something special in mind – revamping I Love Rock 'n' Roll into an explosive hard rock triumph.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Mike-Dirnt-Discography.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Are The Top 10 Highest-Grossing Songs In Mike Dirnt’s Discography, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Strumming strings and crafting rhythms that can make the heart dance ...</span><p>This electrifying rendition struck gold on charts across America, soaring straight to number one faster than you can say "rock on!" But its success didn't stop there – this powerhouse track quickly climbed its way into history books as one of humanity's best-selling singles ever made.</p><p>Over ten million copies danced into eager hands all over the planet.</p><h2 id=respect-by-aretha-franklin-1967><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Respect, By Aretha Franklin (1967)</span></h2><p>Back in 1965, <a href=#>the legendary Otis Redding</a> penned and belted out what can only be described as a downright soulful ditty. It was all about demanding respect from his lover, and he hit those high notes with passion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Redding is a legend in his own right ... then the Queen of Soul herself (Aretha Franklin) came along and sprinkled her magic dust on this gem. She took it upon herself to add her signature touch for an album called I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You.</p><p>Aretha's remake transformed this song into a feminist anthem for all ages – Ms. Franklin demanded nothing short of utmost respect from her man, coupled with the track's famous spelling bee moment (where "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" echoes through our speakers or earbuds). And the result was nothing less than hit making, chart-topping success, the kind that lights up every jukebox and radio.</p><p>Aretha's rendition of Respect became more than just a song; it was an anthem for the ages—a siren call heard from sea to shining sea.</p><h2 id=nothing-compares-2-u-by-sin-eacute-ad-o-39-connor-1990><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Nothing Compares 2 U, By Sinéad O'Connor (1990)</span></h2><p>Prince, the legendary musician and entertainer, penned and performed the initial rendition of this captivating tune back in 1985. It was a funky pop anthem that oozed with his ache for a lost flame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As many people probably know, Sinéad O'Connor (an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Irish singer-songwriter and fierce activist</a>) put her own spin on it when she recorded it for her second album entitled I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got. This remake was like nothing we had ever heard before ... Sinéad stripped it down to its bare bones, and poured out raw emotion into every single note.</p><p>She transformed the song into a heartfelt ballad that showcased her distinctive voice, and a video debuting her signature shaved head style. During the wild ride that was the 1990s, this track became one of those mega-selling singles, with over 10 million copies flying off shelves in countries across the globe.</p><h2 id=hallelujah-by-jeff-buckley-1994><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Hallelujah, By Jeff Buckley (1994)</span></h2><p>Back in the iconic year of 1984, the one and only Leonard Cohen unleashed this genre defying musical masterpiece upon us. The track was a bona fide trailblazer of folk rock, spinning an intricate web of love, faith, and doubt that has resonated across generations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ten years later, Jeff Buckley (a talented American singer-songwriter and guitarist who left an indelible mark on our souls) set his sights on Hallelujah. Buckley's rendition of Cohen's timeless gem came alive on his album Grace – which became his magnum opus during his all-too-short life.</p><p>His remake breathed new life into the song, transforming it into something utterly haunting. With a voice that could melt your heart faster than butter on a sizzling pan and guitar skills that made angels weep tears of joy, Buckley took us on an emotional rollercoaster ride.</p><p>But tragedy struck when fate dealt a cruel hand to the young artist – Buckley passed away in a 1997 swimming accident, leaving behind this extraordinary re-imagining as part of his legacy. Little did he know that his cover version would see success beyond anyone's wildest dreams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Soon after his untimely departure from this mortal coil, word spread like wildfire about this divine interpretation he had gifted us with. It quickly morphed into one of those evergreen tunes – you know, the kind that everyone wanted to put their own spin on.</p><h2 id=i-will-always-love-you-by-whitney-houston-1992><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>I Will Always Love You, By Whitney Houston (1992)</span></h2><p>Back in 1974, the one and only Dolly Parton, a true legend of the country music scene, penned and performed an original masterpiece. This country ballad served as her heartfelt goodbye to none other than her former partner and mentor, the incomparable Porter Wagoner.</p><p>Then the incomparable Whitney Houston lent her extraordinary voice to recreate Dolly's gem, for the soundtrack of The Bodyguard (a flick she starred in alongside Kevin Costner). When Whitney got hold of that tune, she turned it into something out-of-this-world powerful ... a pop soul power ballad that not only showcased Houston's lauded vocal range, but also tugged at heartstrings like never before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When this remake hit airwaves worldwide, it blasted its way straight to number one, and stayed there. Fans from Sydney all the way down to Rio de Janeiro helped the song top charts and break records.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parton.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>10 Ways Dolly Parton Earns Her Fortune</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Dolly Parton makes her riches outside the limelight too.</span><h2 id=fast-car-by-jonas-blue-feat-dakota-2015><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Fast Car, By Jonas Blue Feat. Dakota (2015)</span></h2><p>When Tracy Chapman unleashed her folk-rock masterpiece Fast Car back in 1988, little did she know that a future British DJ and producer would take it to soaring new heights. The original track spun a tale of hope for a young couple yearning to escape their poverty-stricken existence.</p><p>In 2015, Jonas Blue took that classic and turned it into a sizzling tropical house dance anthem. Yes, that's right – this talented musician didn't just add a little spice to the original; he lit the stage on fire!</p><p>Joining forces with British singer Dakota, Jonas Blue created a masterpiece that blended irresistible beats with soulful vocals. The result? Pure magic that resonated across airwaves far and wide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cruising its way up charts like a speed demon, this vibrant remake conquered hearts worldwide. It zoomed into second place on the UK Singles Chart and triumphantly soared atop the US Dance Club Songs chart at number one spot.</p><p>Here's where things really revved up: Fast Car became an unstoppable force online as well. Streams flowed endlessly from music lovers' fingertips, racking up over <a href=#>one billion spins on Spotify alone</a> in 2016 – some serious road mileage.</p><p>Fast Car is unique on this list for another reason: a subsequent cover of the song hit it big in 2023. On September 25th, Billboard reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country singer Luke Combs' cover of Fast Car was again topping charts</a>.</p><p>Billboard quoted Combs on the song's resurgence, and said he was happy to reintroduce the track to fans of the genre:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What an awesome way to end the ride for ‘Fast Car’ ... It has been so cool to see everyone enjoying this song over the past few months, whether it was people who were hearing the song for the first time or people [for whom] it brought back memories of Tracy’s timeless recording. I’m just glad this song got another life because it deserves to be around forever; it will always be one of my favorites. I’m glad we got to park Tracy’s song at the top of the Hot Country Songs chart, where it should be."</p><p>These hugely successful song remakes have flipped music genres upside down while showcasing how artists can transform mere sounds into sheer magic ... sometimes with the same songs. From tropical escapades to demands for respect, each remake has left its legacy in the music realm - proving once again that great songs are timeless treasures we'll cherish forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKeenHqzscyaop6rXam1osCMnpirppWZeq61y6WgqKajZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsong-remakes-that-earned-millions.html&text=Song%20Remakes%20That%20Earned%20Millions&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsong-remakes-that-earned-millions.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsong-remakes-that-earned-millions.html&title=Song%20Remakes%20That%20Earned%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsong-remakes-that-earned-millions.html&title=Song%20Remakes%20That%20Earned%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsong-remakes-that-earned-millions.html&title=Song%20Remakes%20That%20Earned%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsong-remakes-that-earned-millions.html&description=Song%20Remakes%20That%20Earned%20Millions" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./blondo-boot-leather-suede-waterproof-rain-sale-reviews.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Suede Boots Are Actually Waterproof and Were Obsessed">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rapper-blueface-arrested-in-las-vegas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rapper Blueface Arrested In Las Vegas: Check Out The Facts">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
