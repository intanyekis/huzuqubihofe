She often spent time on sets with her aunts and made her big screen debut with a small role in <i>Blow</i> when she was nine. She began her career as a young artist and starred in a Nickelodeon show before returning to movies.

Her real estate history dates back to 2010, when she bought a million-dollar starter home. Since then, she has lived in two properties, and her newest purchase is a $3.6 million Hollywood Hills home that belongs to actress Minnie Driver. Designed to perfection with a charming exterior, let’s take at everything we know about Emma Roberts’ $3.6 million Hollywood Hills mansion.</p><h2 id=a-home-for-new-beginnings>A Home For New Beginnings</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Emma Roberts had been hunting for a new property since late 2021</a>. After her split with boyfriend Garrett Hedlund, the couple bought their Los Feliz home for close to $2 million. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a>, the Spanish-style home quickly found a buyer. Since then, Roberts searched for a new home and found a stunning property on sale for $3.6 million with Minnie Driver as the owner. Driver had purchased the house in 2014 for $2.5 million and spent eight blissful years with her family before deciding to move. After she bought the property in 2012, the 1940s structure underwent a series of renovations to become a vintage and chic estate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Peek Inside Rafael Nadal's Splendid Collection Of Homes</a></span></p><p>Minnie Driver appointed celebrity interior designer Peter Dunham for the makeover. Known for his warm and tasteful palette, Dunham helped the actress renovate the traditional-style home with furnishings. Featuring three bedrooms and four bathrooms, Roberts’ new Hollywood Hills home also has various chic recreational rooms and standard amenities made for comfort, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>. The property primarily has vintage furnishings, color fabrics, soaring ceilings, and dark hardwood floors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=designed-with-the-best-in-business>Designed With The Best In Business&nbsp;</h2><p>The 2,730 square feet home is tucked away on a 0.5-acre of land secured with a double gate at the end of the street. The single-level home has a primary residence of 2 bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms, while the guests can stay in a cozy 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom detached cottage. The entrance is met with a formal living room that features a wood-burning fireplace and a large glass bay window overlooking the backyard. The casual family room with vintage furnishings leads to the kitchen boasting Viking high-end cooking appliances. It is adjoining the breakfast nook with mismatched-colored chairs and a built-in banquette.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Each living space in the home, including the bedrooms, has built-in bookshelves for a comforting interior. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, Roberts has a massive magazine collection, and the actress is known to buy over 50 magazines each month. The actress reportedly plans to create space for her collection in each house room. The Master Suite has a romantic décor with French doors open to a stunning view. Attached is an unsuited bathroom with a soaking tub, a Venetian mirror, and a shower room. Additionally, the suite also comes with a large walk-in closet.</p><h2 id=the-enviable-outdoors>The Enviable Outdoors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The guest suites in the home have an equally stunning interior</a> with views of California and mature trees in the backyard. Roberts has incredible outdoors with the new home as it features lush trees surrounding the property and gated fencing. The backyard has an oasis theme as it boasts a gazebo and a lagoon-style pool, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>. Every space in the backyard has been built for multi-purpose use.</p><p>Along the pool are large decorative boulders that enhance the effect of the space, while the vintage seating chairs are built for relaxation. The gazebo features a round table with chairs and ample space around the grassy backyard for a daytime event. While Emma Roberts opted for colonial-revival and Mediterranean classic homes with her earlier purchases, she chose a traditional home that encompassed vintage interiors while maintaining chic décor.</p><p>Emma Roberts found a perfect home for her family in 2022 with the traditional-style property that belonged to Minnie Driver.
