The only other actress to repeat such as experience was <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez, who just so happens also to be a Latin American actress</a>, in the 1995 action-comedy, Money Train. However, acting isn't her only talent as she is also an accomplished choreographer, author, and activist against the spread of AIDS. With a net worth of $12 million, here are Rosie Perez's 9 highest-grossing films, ranked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pitch-perfect-2---287-215-million>Pitch Perfect 2 - $287.215 Million</h2><p>Following the success of the first film in 2012 which featured much of the same cast of characters and earned a box office win of $115.4 million globally,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Pitch Perfect 2 largely out-performed its predecessor</a>. The musical comedy follows the Barden Bellas a cappella singing group which is led by Beca Mitchell (Anna Hendricks) and Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow). However, when Patricia "Fat Amy" Hobart (Rebel Wilson) has a moment of indecent exposure when her pants accidentally ripped in front of <a href=#>former President Barack Obama </a>during his birthday celebration, the Bellas' are suspended from the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA). Despite the setback of their suspension, they pushed forward to an exceptional win. Cameos in the movie came from Rosie Perez, Rosie O'Donnell, Snoop Dogg, Pharrell Williams, and Barack and Michelle Obama. The film grossed $287.215 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=birds-of-prey---201-852-million>Birds Of Prey - $201.852 Million</h2><p>Formally called Birds of Prey (And The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), the 2020 superhero film is<a href=#> based on the DC Comics</a> team of the same name. It follows the twister humor of the Joker who has ended his relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and throws her out onto the streets of Gotham. She is rescued by the owner of a Taiwanese restaurant named Doc and tried to deal with the breakup by getting drunk at a nightclub run by the narcissistic crime lord, Roman Sionis, <a href=#>played by Ewan McGregor.</a> She gets very intoxicated at the nightclub and is saved by a singer named Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell). Renee Montaya (Rosie Perez) is a Gotham City Police Detective who realizes that Harley is in danger without the Joker's protection and tried to make Dinah an informant. Loaded with action and suspense, the film grossed $201.852 million internationally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-other-guys---170-936-million>The Other Guys - $170.936 Million</h2><p>Whenever you take two unlikely <a href=#>actors the likes of Mel Gibson</a> and Danny Glover in the Lethal Weapon franchise, for example, the result is usually an action-packed comedy that never fails to deliver. The same can be said for the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2010 buddy cop film, The Other Guys,</a> starring Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. The film follows two NYPD detectives: Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg), a hot-tempered cop and Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell), a forensic accountant with a calm demeanor. They're given no respect by the rest of the department, especially from Christopher Danson played by Dwayne Johnson and P.K. Highsmith <a href=#>acted by Samuel L. Jackson</a>, who are regarded as NYC's top cops. However, their luck could turn around after beginning an investigation into a scaffolding permit violation by Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan) and his client, Pamela Boardman from Lendl CEO, who has a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley (Ray Stevenson) on her payroll to ensure Ershon pays his dues. Rosie Perez appears for a cameo in the movie along with Ice-T and Derek Jeter, and it ended up grossing $170.936 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=pineapple-express---102-404-million>Pineapple Express - $102.404 Million</h2><p><a href=#>With all the controversy surrounding Amber Heard,</a> here is another movie besides Aquaman and The Rum Diary starring her ex-husband Johnny Depp -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Pineapple Express.</a> Co-written by and starring Seth Rogan, the stoner comedy film follows the lethargic life of Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) who has more interest in being a marijuana enthusiast than he does in his job as a process server. After smoking a new strain of weed called Pineapple Express with his drug dealer, Saul (James Franco), he returns to work and arrives at the residence of the ruthless drug lord, Ted Jones (Gary Cole) where he witnesses the murder of an Asian man at the hands of Ted and Officer Carol Brazier (<a href=#>Rosie Perez</a>). After realizing that he witnessed the murder, Ted and Officer Carol track him down by the smell of the weed he was smoking. Dale then goes to warn his girlfriend Angie (Amber Heard) and her parents to leave their home as Ted's henchmen will be looking for them. The film grossed $102.404 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>How Woody Harrelson Became A Hollywood Star And Grew His $70 Million Fortune</a></strong></span></p><h2 id=white-men-can-t-jump---90-753-million>White Men Can't Jump - $90.753 Million</h2><p>One of Perez's most iconic films came early in her career and helped catapult her into various other acting opportunities, being that she was starring alongside some of the most sought-after Hollywood stars of that era. In 1992, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">White Men Can't Jump</a> was released as a sports comedy starring two unlikely paired streetball hustlers named Sydney Deane (Wesley Snipes) and<a href=#> Billy Hoyle played by Woody Harrelson</a>. Sydney is a well-known streetball hustler who supports his wife, Rhonda Deane (Tyra Ferrell), and his children and Billy is also a streetball hustler who everyone assumes can't play because he is white, which works to his advantage when he shows his skills on the court. He and his girlfriend, Gloria (Rosie Perez) are constantly on the run from mobsters for a gambling debt that owes. In order to help each other, Billy and Sydney become hustling partners to meet their needs. The film remains a classic and grossed $90.753 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-counselor---71-009-million>The Counselor - $71.009 Million</h2><p>Although it wasn't a complete flop at the box office, the 2013 crime thriller, The Counselor, wasn't the most favorable movie in the eyes of critics. Covering topics such as greed, love, trust, and betrayal in the confines of the Mexican drug trade, the film surrounds the life of a Texan lawyer known as The Counselor, <a href=#>enacted by Michael Fassbender </a>who is preparing to propose to his girlfriend Laura (PenÃ©lope Cruz). He does, and she accepts, however, he is also preparing to go on his first drug deal with his friend Reiner (Javier Bardem). The Counselor meets with Reiner's business investor, Westray (Brad Pitt) who warns him that he should be less conspicuous as the Mexican cartel is ruthless. Rosie Perez plays the role of Ruth, one of The Counselor's clients who is in prison for murder. Other main characters include <a href=#>Cameron Diaz who acts as Malkina,</a> Reiner's girlfriend. With a budget of $25 million, the movie grossed $71.009 million internationally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-road-to-el-dorado---65-2-million>The Road To El Dorado - $65.2 Million</h2><p>It wouldn't be right if the whipping tongue of Rosie Perez wasn't the voice behind some animated movie. In the year 2000, the DreamWorks Animation production released The Road To El Dorado, which at the time was the third animated released by the animation studio. The film is set in 1519 and follows two con-artists, Miguel (Kenneth Branagh) and Tulio, <a href=#>voiced by Kevin Kline </a>who win a map to the City of Gold, El Dorado. They steal a row boat and begin their quest for gold only to be met by an El Dorado native woman named Chel (Rosie Perez) who was being chased by guards. The guards bring both men and Chel to Chief Tannabok (Edward James Olmos) and priest Tzekel-Kan (Armand Assante) who they con. Chel catches on to their deceit but promises to keep her mouth shut once they can take her off of the island. The film was a flop, however, grossing $65.2 million against a $95 million budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=it-could-happen-to-you---37-78-million>It Could Happen To You - $37.78 Million</h2><p>Perhaps one of her first major roles came in 1994 in <a href=#>the romantic comedy-drama, It Could Happen To You</a>. This movie is so genuine and true to its name that the plot was inspired by a real-life story. It follows a down-to-earth and generous <a href=#>New York City </a>Policeman named Charlie Lang (Nicolas Cage) and his materialistic wife, Muriel (Rosie Perez), who works in a hairdressing salon and complains incessantly about what they're lacking in life. One day, Charlie meets Yvonne (Bridget Fonda), a waitress who serves at a diner he frequents who happens to be going through a divorce with her husband Eddie (Stanley Tucci) but is unable to pay for it because he spent $12,000 from her credit card without asking. Charlie can't tip her, but jokes about being able to double his tip or give her half of his earnings <a href=#>once he wins the lottery</a> for $4 million, which he does. He keeps his word, which infuriates Muriel, and, due to his generous nature and giving to the homeless and hungry, she divorces him. In the end, Muriel gets played by a con man named Jack Gross and ends up working as a hairdresser again, while Charlie and Yvonne get married and live happily ever after. It grossed $37.784 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=do-the-right-thing---26-65-million>Do The Right Thing - $26.65 Million</h2><p>Released at the start of her professional career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Do The Right Thing </a>was definitely one of Rosie Perez's breakout films when it was released in 1989. Written, directed, and produced by the multitalented <a href=#>filmmaker, Spike Lee, the film </a>focuses on the racial tension between the Italian-American and the African American citizens of Brooklyn that escalates into a violent and tragic ending on a blood-boiling summer day. This movie was also a breakout for many other upcoming actors at the time including Bill Nunn, who had the main role of Radio Raheem, Martin Lawrence, Giancarlo Esposito, <a href=#>Samuel L. Jackson</a>, and of course, Rosie Perez. Against a modest budget of $6 million, the film more than tripled in profits and grossed $26.65 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Anchorman: 9 Highest-Grossing Will Ferrell Movies</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Times</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spirituality and Practice</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent Critic</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMoaCgoJWowW6z0aiqrKGenHqzu9KinGaolaeyu3nFoqOmq12nrq%2B3xJ1m</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-highest-grossing-rosie-perez-films-ranked.html&text=The%20Highest-Grossing%20Rosie%20Perez%20Films%2c%20Ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-highest-grossing-rosie-perez-films-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-highest-grossing-rosie-perez-films-ranked.html&title=The%20Highest-Grossing%20Rosie%20Perez%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-highest-grossing-rosie-perez-films-ranked.html&title=The%20Highest-Grossing%20Rosie%20Perez%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-highest-grossing-rosie-perez-films-ranked.html&title=The%20Highest-Grossing%20Rosie%20Perez%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-highest-grossing-rosie-perez-films-ranked.html&description=The%20Highest-Grossing%20Rosie%20Perez%20Films%2c%20Ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./11-living-mattel-barbie-dolls.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Living Mattel Barbie Dolls">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sommer-ray-siblings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sommer Ray Siblings: The Ray Siblings Making Their Own Mark">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
